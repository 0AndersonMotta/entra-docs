# Configuring Role claim issued in the SAML token for enterprise applications in Azure Active Directory

This feature allows users to customize the claim type for ‘roles’ claim in the response token received upon authorizing an app using Azure AD.

## Prerequisites
- An Azure AD subscription with directory setup
- A single sign-on enabled subscription
- You must configure SSO with your application

## When to use this feature

If your application expects custom roles to be passed in SAML response, you need to use this feature. This feature allows you to create as many roles as you need to be passed back from Azure AD to your application.

## Steps to use this feature

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type the name of your application, select your application from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Application in the results list](./media/active-directory-enterprise-app-role-management/tutorial_app_addfromgallery.png)

5. Once the application is added, go to **Properties** page and copy the **Object ID**

	![Properties Page](./media/active-directory-enterprise-app-role-management/tutorial_app_properties.png)

6. Open [Azure AD Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer) in another window.

	a. Sign in to the Graph Explorer site using the global Admin/Co-admin credentials for your tenant.

	b. Change the version to **beta** and fetch the list of service Principals from your tenant using following query:
		
	- `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals`

	- If you are using multiple directories, then you should follow this pattern
	`https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/contoso.com/servicePrincipals`

		![Graph explorer dialog box](./media/active-directory-enterprise-app-role-management/graph-explorer1-updated.png)

	c. From the list of service Principals fetched, get the one you need to modify. You can also use the Ctrl+F to search the application from all the listed ServicePrincipals. Search for the **Object id**, which you have copied from Properties page and use following query to get to the respective Service Principal.

	- `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals/<objectID>`.

	d. Extract the appRoles property from the service principal object.

	![Graph explorer dialog box](./media/active-directory-enterprise-app-role-management/graph-explorer-approles.png)

	e. You need to generate new roles for your application now. You can download Azure AD role Generator from [here](https://app.box.com/s/jw6m9p9ehmf4ut5jx8xhcw87cu09ml3y).

	f. Open the Azure AD Generator and perform following steps -

	![Azure AD Generator](./media/active-directory-enterprise-app-role-management/azure_ad_role_generator.png)

	- Enter **Role Name**, **Role Description** and **Role Value**. Click **Add** to add the role

	- After you have added all the required roles, click **Generate**

	- Copy the content by clicking **Copy Content**

	> [!NOTE] 
	> Please make sure that you have **msiam_access** user role and the id is matching in the generated role. If you have more **msiam_access** roles for the Service Principal then you should add/replace them in the same sequence in the tool generated roles.

	g. Go back to your Graph Explorer. Change the method from **GET** to **PATCH**. Patch the service principal object to have desired appRoles by updating appRoles property with the copied values. Click **Run Query**.

	![Graph explorer dialog box](./media/active-directory-enterprise-app-role-management/graph-explorer-patch.png)

	> [!NOTE]
	> Following is an example of appRoles object. 
	> 
	>	```
	>	{
	>	"appRoles": [
	>	{
	>	"allowedMemberTypes": [
	>	"User"
	>	],
	>	"description": "msiam_access",
	>	"displayName": "msiam_access", "id": "******************************",
	>	"isEnabled": true,
	>	"origin": "Application",
	>	"value": null
	>	},
	>	{
	>	"allowedMemberTypes": [
	>	"User"
	>	],
	>	"description": "**********",
	>	"displayName": "**********",
	>	"id": "*************",
	>	"isEnabled": true,
	>	"origin": "ServicePrincipal",
	>	"value": "******************"
	>	}
	>	]
	>	}
	>
	>	```

7. After the service principal is patched with more roles, we can assign users to the respective roles. This can be done by going to Portal and navigating to the respective app. Then, clicking on the **Users and Groups** tab on top. This process will list all the users or groups.

	a. To assign a role to any user, just select the particular user/group and click on **Assign** button in the bottom part of the page.

	b. Clicking that brings a pop-up to select a role from different roles that are defined for the respective service principal.

	c. Choose the required role and click on submit.

8. After assigning roles to the users, we need to update **Attributes** table to define customized mapping of **role** claim.

9. In the **User Attributes** section on the **Single sign-on** dialog, configure SAML token attribute as shown in the image and perform the following steps:
	
	| Attribute Name | Attribute Value |
	| ------------------- | -------------------- |    
	| Role Name 		  | user.assignedrole |

	a. Click **Add attribute** to open the **Add Attribute** dialog.

	![Configure Single Sign-On Add](./media/active-directory-enterprise-app-role-management/tutorial_attribute_04.png)

	![Configure Single Sign-On Attribute](./media/active-directory-enterprise-app-role-management/tutorial_attribute_05.png)

	b. In the **Name** textbox, type the attribute name shown for that row.

	c. From the **Value** list, type the attribute value shown for that row.

	d. Leave the **Namespace** blank.
	
	e. Click **Ok**.

10. To test your application in IDP initiated Single Sign on, log into the Access Panel (https://myapps.microsoft.com ) and click on your application tile. You should see different roles to choose from. Choose the desired role and now click on Sign In button to use that role in your application.

11. To update an existing role, perform following steps -

	![Graph explorer dialog box](./media/active-directory-enterprise-app-role-management/graph-explorer-patchupdate.png)

	- Open Graph Explorer and find the Service Principal.

	- Select **PATCH**.
	
	- Update the value of role by replacing the **description** and **displayname** with the updated value.
	
	- Click **Run Query**. 

12. To delete an  existing role, perform following steps -

	![Graph explorer dialog box](./media/active-directory-enterprise-app-role-management/graph-explorer-patchdelete.png)

	- Open Graph Explorer and find the Service Principal.
	
	- Select **PATCH**.
	
	- Find the role which you need to delete.
	
	- Set the **IsEnabled** property to **false**.
	
	- Click **Run Query**.
	
	- Update the appRoles section by removing the specific role.
	
	- Click **Run Query**.

> [!NOTE]
> The role needs to be disabled first before it can be removed.
