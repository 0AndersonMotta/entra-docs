# GDPR compliance and Azure AD Connect Health 

In May 2018, a European privacy law, the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/index_en.htm), is due to take effect. The GDPR imposes new rules on companies, government agencies, non-profits, and other organizations that offer goods and services to people in the European Union (EU), or that collect and analyze data tied to EU residents. The GDPR applies no matter where you are located. 

Microsoft products and services are available today to help you meet the GDPR requirements. Read more about Microsoft Privacy policy at [Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter)

Azure AD Connect Health provides monitoring, insights, and alert functionality for your on-premises identity infrastructure and synchronization service. We are committed to GDPR compliance across our cloud services when enforcement begins May 2018 and provide GDPR-related assurances in our contractual commitments.
