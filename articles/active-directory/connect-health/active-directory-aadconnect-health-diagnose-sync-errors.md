# Diagnose and remediate duplicated attribute sync errors

## Overview
Taking one step farther to highlight sync errors, Azure Active Directory Connect Health introduces self-service remediation. It troubleshoots duplicated attribute sync errors and fixes objects that are orphaned from Azure AD.
The diagnosis feature has these key benefits:
- It provides a diagnostic procedure that narrows down duplicated attribute sync error scenarios and gives specific resolutions.
- It applies a fix for dedicated scenarios from Azure AD to resolve the error in a single step.
- No upgrade or configuration is required to enable this feature.
For more details about Azure AD, see [Identity synchronization and duplicate attribute resiliency](https://aka.ms/dupattributeresdocs).

## Problems
### A common scenario
When **QuarantinedAttributeValueMustBeUnique** and **AttributeValueMustBeUnique** sync errors happen, it's common to see a **UserPrincipalName** or **Proxy Addresses** conflict in Azure AD. You might solve the sync errors by updating the conflicting source object from the on-premises side. The sync error will be resolved after the following synchronization. 
For example, this image indicates that two users have a conflict of their **UserPrincipalName** as *Joe.J@contoso.com*. The conflicting objects are quarantined in Azure AD.

### Orphaned object scenario
Occasionally, you might find that an existing user loses the **sourceAnchor**. The deletion of the source object happened in on-premises Azure AD. But the change of deletion signal never got synchronized to Azure AD. This happens for reasons like sync engine issues or domain migration. When the same object gets restored or recreated, logically, an existing user should be the user to synchronize from the **sourceAnchor**. When an existing user is a cloud-only object, you can also see the conflicting user synchronized to Azure AD. The user can't be matched in sync to the existing object. There's no direct way to remap the **sourceAnchor**. See more about the [existing KB](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2647098). 
As an example, the existing object in Azure AD preserves the license of Joe. A newly synchronized object with a different **sourceAnchor** occurs in a duplicated attribute state in Azure AD. Changes for Joe in on-premises AD won't be applied to Joeâ€™s original user (existing object) in Azure AD.

## Diagnostic and troubleshooting steps in Connect Health 
The diagnose feature supports user objects with following duplicated attributes:

| Attribute Name | Synchronization Error Types|
| ------------------ | -----------------|
| UserPrincipalName | QuarantinedAttributeValueMustBeUnique or AttributeValueMustBeUnique | 
| ProxyAddresses | QuarantinedAttributeValueMustBeUnique or AttributeValueMustBeUnique | 
| SipProxyAddress | AttributeValueMustBeUnique | 
| OnPremiseSecurityIdentifier |  AttributeValueMustBeUnique |

>[!IMPORTANT]
> To access this feature, **Global Admin** permission or **Contributor** are required from RBAC settings.

Follow the steps from the Azure portal to narrow down the sync error details and provide more specific solutions:

![Sync error diagnosis steps](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-health-sync-iidfix/IIdFixSteps.png)

From the Azure portal, take a few steps to identify specific fixable scenarios:  
1.	Check the **Diagnose status** column. The status shows if there's a possible way to fix a sync error directly from Azure Active Directory. In other words, a troubleshooting flow exists that can narrow down the error case and potentially fix it.
| Status | What does it mean? |
| ------------------ | -----------------|
| Not Started | You haven't visited this diagnosis process. Depending on the diagnostic result, there is a potential way to fix the sync error directly from the portal. |
| Manual Fix Required | The error doesn't fit the criteria of available fixes from the portal. The case can be either (1) conflicting object types aren't users, or (2) you already went through the diagnostic steps, and no fix resolution was available from the portal. In the second case, a fix from the on-premises side is still one of the solutions. [Read more about on-premises fixes](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2647098) | 
| Pending Sync | A fix was applied. The portal is waiting for the next sync cycle to clear the error. |
  >[!IMPORTANT]
  > The diagnostic status column will reset after each sync cycle. 
  >

2.	Select the **Diagnose** button under the error details. You'll answer a few questions and identify the sync error details. Answers to the questions help identify an orphaned object case.

3.	If a **Close** button appears at the end of the diagnostics, there's no quick fix available from the portal based on your answers. Refer to the solution shown in the last step. Fixes from on-premises are still the solutions. Select the **Close** button. The status of the current sync error switches to **Manual fix required**. The status remains during the current synchronization cycle.

4.	After an orphaned object case is identified, you can fix the duplicated attributes sync errors directly from the portal. To trigger the process, select the **Apply Fix** button. The status of the current sync error updates to **Pending sync**.

5.	After the next sync cycle, the error should be removed from the list.

## How to answer the diagnosis questions 
### Does the user exist in your on-premises Azure Active Directory?

This question tries to identify the source object of the existing user from on-premises Azure Active Directory.  
1.	Check if your Azure Active Directory has an object with the provided **UserPrincipalName**. If not, answer **No**.
2.	If it does, check whether the object is still in scope for syncing.  
  - Search in the Azure AD connector space with the distinguished name (DN).
  - If the object is found with the **Pending Add** state, answer **No**. AAD Connect isn't able to connect the object to the right Azure AD object.
  - If the object isn't found, answer **Yes**.

In the following examples, the question tries to identify whether **Joe Jackson** still exists in on-premises Azure Active Directory.
For the **common scenario**, both users **Joe Johnson** and **Joe Jackson** are present in the on-premises Azure Active Directory. The quarantined objects are two different users.

![Diagnose sync error common scenario](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-health-sync-iidfix/IIdFixCommonCase.png)

For the **orphaned object scenario**, only the single user **Joe Johnson** is present in the on-premises Azure Active Directory:

![Diagnose sync error orphaned object *does user exist* scenario](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-health-sync-iidfix/IIdFixOrphanedCase.png)

### Do both of these accounts belong to the same user?
This question checks an incoming conflicting user and the existing user object in Azure AD to see whether they belong to the same user.  
1.	The conflicting object is newly synced to Azure Active Directory. Compare the objects' attributes:  
  - Display Name
  - User Principal Name
  - Object ID
2.	If Azure AD fails to compare them, check whether your Azure Active Directory has objects with the provided **UserPrincipalNames**. Answer **No** if you find both.

In the following example, the two objects belong to the same user **Joe Johnson**.

## What happens after the fix is applied in the orphaned object scenario
Based on the answers to the preceding questions, you'll see the **Apply Fix** button when there is a fix available from Azure AD. In this case, the on-premises object is synchronizing with an unexpected Azure AD object. The two objects are mapped by using the **sourceAnchor**. **Apply Fix** change performs steps like these:
- Updates the **sourceAnchor** to the correct object in Azure AD.
- Deletes the conflicting object in Azure AD if it is present.

![Diagnose sync error after the fix](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-health-sync-iidfix/IIdFixAfterFix.png)

>[!IMPORTANT]
> The **Apply Fix** change applies only to orphaned object cases.
>

After completing the preceding steps, the user can access the original resource, which is a link to an existing object. 
The **Diagnose status** value in the list view updates to **Pending Sync**.
The sync error will be resolved after the following synchronization. Connect Health will no longer show the resolved sync error in the list view.


## FAQ
 -	What happens if execution of the **Apply Fix** fails?
If execution fails, it's possible that Azure AD Connect is running an export error. Refresh the portal page and retry after the following synchronization. The default synchronization cycle is 30 minutes. 

 -	What if the **existing object** should be the object to be deleted?  
If existing object should be deleted, the process doesn't involve a change of **sourceAnchor**. You should be able to fix it from your on-premises Azure AD.  

 -	What permission does a user need to apply the fix?  
Global Administrator or Contributor in the RBAC settings have permission to access the diagnostic and troubleshooting process.

 -	Do I have to configure AAD Connect or update the Azure AD Connect Health agent for this feature?  
No, the diagnosis process is a complete cloud-based feature.

 - 	If the existing object is soft deleted, will the diagnosis process make the object active again?  
No, the fix won't update object attributes other than **sourceAnchor**.
