# How to configure Azure Active Directory joined devices

With device management in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can ensure that your users are accessing your resources from devices that meet your standards for security and compliance. For more details, see [Introduction to device management in Azure Active Directory](device-management-introduction.md).

If you want to bring work-owned Windows 10 devices under the control of Azure AD, you can accomplish this by configuring Azure AD joined devices. This topic provides you with the related steps. 


## Before you begin

To register a Windows 10 device, the device registration service must be configured to enable you to register devices. In addition to having permission to registering devices in your Azure AD tenant, you must have fewer devices registered than the configured maximum. 

## What you should know

When registering a device, you should keep the following in mind:

- Windows registers the device in the organizationâ€™s directory in Azure AD

- You might be required to go through multi-factor authentication challenge. This challenge is configurable by your IT administrator.

- Azure AD checks whether the device requires mobile device management enrollment and enrolls it if applicable.

- If you are a managed user, Windows takes you to the desktop through the automatic sign-in.

- If you are a federated user, you will be taken to a Windows sign-in screen to enter your credentials.


## Registering a device

**To register your Windows 10 device:**
