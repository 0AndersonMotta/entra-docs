# Add accounts to the Microsoft Authenticator app - Overview

>[!Important]
>This content is intended for users. If you're an administrator, you can find more information about how to set up and manage your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) environment in the [Azure Active Directory Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory).

The Microsoft Authenticator app helps you prove your identity without needing to remember a password. Instead of a password, your sign-in using your username and your mobile device with your fingerprint, face, or PIN to confirm that you are in fact, you. Two-factor verification is considered more secure than just a password, especially while viewing sensitive info.

## What account types can I add
You can turn two-factor verification on for many accounts that you use every day. This includes:

|Account type|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|Work or school accounts|The account you've been given by your work or school organization, for example alain@contoso.com. For information about how to add a work or school account to the Microsoft Authenticator app, see [Add your work or school account](microsoft-authenticator-app-add-work-account.md).|
|Personal accounts|The Microsoft and non-Microsoft accounts you've personally opened, such as for Outlook.com, Xbox LIVE, Google, Facebook, and more. For information about how to add a personal account to the Microsoft Authenticator app, see [Add your personal account](microsoft-authenticator-app-add-personal-account.md).|

## What happens if I can't use a QR code?
If your camera is unable to capture the QR code, you can manually add your account information to the Microsoft Authenticator app for two-factor verification. For more information and how to do it, see [Manually add your account](microsoft-authenticator-app-add-account-manual.md).
