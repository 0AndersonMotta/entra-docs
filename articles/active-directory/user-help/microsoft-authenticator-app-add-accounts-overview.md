# Overview about adding accounts to the Microsoft Authenticator app

>[!Important]
>This content is intended for users. If you're an administrator, you can find more information about how to set up and manage your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) environment in the [Azure Active Directory Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory).

The Microsoft Authenticator app helps you prove your identity without needing to remember a password. Instead of a password, you sign-in using your username and your mobile device with your fingerprint, face, or PIN to confirm that you are in fact, you. Two-factor verification is considered more secure than just a password, especially while viewing sensitive info.

## What account types can I add
You can turn on two-factor verification for many accounts that you use every day, including:

|Account type|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|Work or school accounts|The account you've been given by your work or school organization, for example alain@contoso.com.|
|Personal accounts|The Microsoft and non-Microsoft accounts you've personally opened, such as for Outlook.com, Xbox LIVE, Google, Facebook, and more.|
