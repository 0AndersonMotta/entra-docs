# Download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app
The Microsoft Authenticator app helps you prove your identity without needing to remember a password. Instead of a password, your sign-in using your username and your mobile device with your fingerprint, face, or PIN to confirm that you are in fact, you. Two-factor verification is considered more secure than just a password, especially while viewing sensitive info.
