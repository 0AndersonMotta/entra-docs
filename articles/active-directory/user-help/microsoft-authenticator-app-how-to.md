# Get started with the Microsoft Authenticator app
The Microsoft Authenticator app helps you prove your identity without needing to remember a password. Instead of a password, your sign-in using your username and your mobile device with your fingerprint, face, or PIN to confirm that you are in fact, you. two-factor verification is considered more secure than just a password, especially while viewing sensitive info.

>[!NOTE]
>If you're having issues signing in to your account, see [When you can't sign in to your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12429) for help.  Get more info about what to do when you receive the [“That Microsoft account doesn't exist”](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13811) message when you try to sign in to your Microsoft account.

## Terminology
|Term|Description|
|----|-----------|
|two-factor verification |A verification process that requires you to specifically use only two pieces of verification info, like a password and a PIN. The Microsoft Authenticator app uses this form of verification.|
|Multi-factor authentication (MFA)|All two-factor verification is multi-factor authentication, requiring you to use *at least* two pieces of verification info, based on your organization's requirements.|
|Microsoft account (also called, MSA)|You create your own personal accounts, to get access to your consumer-oriented Microsoft products and cloud services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Xbox LIVE, or Office 365. Your Microsoft account is created and stored in the Microsoft consumer identity account system that's run by Microsoft.|
|Work or school account|Your organization creates your work or school account (such as alain@contoso.com) to let you access internal and potentially restricted resources, such as Microsoft Azure, Windows Intune, and Office 365.|

## Who decides to use this feature?
Depending on your account type, your organization might decide that you have to use two-factor verification, or you might be able to decide for yourself.

- **Work or school account.** If you're using a work or school account (for example, alain@contoso.com), it's up to your organization whether you must use two-factor verification, along with the specific verification methods. For more information about multi-factor verification, see [What does Azure Multi-Factor Authentication mean for me](multi-factor-authentication-end-user.md). For more information about how to set up Security info to use the Microsoft Authentication app, see [Set up security info to use an authenticator app (preview)](security-info-setup-auth-app.md).

- **Personal Microsoft account.** You can choose to set up two-factor verification for your personal Microsoft accounts (for example, alain@outlook.com).

- **Non-Microsoft personal account.** You can choose to set up two-factor verification for your non-Microsoft personal accounts (for example, alain@gmail.com). Your non-Microsoft accounts might not use the term, two-factor verification, but you should be able to find the feature within the **Security** or the **Sign-in** settings. For more information, watch these [Microsoft Customer Support videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyhj1WZ29G65QdD9NxTOAm8HwOS-OBUrX) to see how to add non-Microsoft personal accounts.

## How this feature works?
two-factor verification specifically works in one of two ways:

- **Notification.** The Microsoft Authenticator app sends a notification asking you to **Approve sign-in**. Choose **Approve** if you recognize the sign-in attempt. Otherwise, choose **Deny**. If you choose **Deny**, you can also mark the request as fraudulent.

- **Verification code.** Type in your username and password for either your work or school account or your personal Microsoft account, and then copy the associated verification code from the **Accounts** screen of the Microsoft Authenticator app.

## Install the app
Install the latest version of the Microsoft Authenticator app, based on your operating system:

- **Android.** On your Android device, go to [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator) and install the Microsoft Authenticator app.

- **iOS.** On your Apple iOS device, go to [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458) and install the Microsoft Authenticator app.

- **Windows Phone.** On your Windows Phone, go to the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-authenticator/9nblgggzmcj6) and install the Microsoft Authenticator app.

## Add your accounts
You can add your work or school accounts and your personal accounts to the Microsoft Authenticator app.

1. On your PC, go to the [Additional security verification](https://aka.ms/mfasetup) page.

    >[!Note]
    >If you don't see the **Additional security verification** page, it's possible that your administrator has turned on the security info preview experience. If that's the case, you should follow the instructions in the [Set up security info to use an authenticator app](security-info-setup-auth-app.md) section. If that's not the case, you will need to contact your organization's Help Desk for assistance.

    The **Accounts** screen of the app shows you your account name and a six-digit verification code. For additional security, the verification code changes every 30 seconds preventing you from using the same code twice.

## To sign in using the app

After you add your accounts to the app, you can use the app to sign in to your accounts.

If you chose to use verification codes in the app, you'll start to see them on the **Accounts** page. The codes change every 30 seconds so that you always have a new code when you need one. But you don't need to do anything with them until you sign in and are prompted to enter a verification code.

### Using your device's fingerprint or facial recognition capabilities

Your organization might require a PIN to complete your identity verification. You can set up the Microsoft Authenticator app to use your device's fingerprint or facial recognition capabilities instead of a PIN. You can set this up the first time you use the authenticator app to verify your account, by selecting the option to use your device biometric capabilities as identification instead of your PIN.
