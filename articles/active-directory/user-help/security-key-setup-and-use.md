# Set up and use a FIDO2 security key (Preview)

## What is FIDO?

[FIDO](https://fidoalliance.org/) (Fast ID Online) is a set of security specifications used for strong authentication, which seeks to standardize authentication at the client and protocol layers. FIDO supports multi-factor authentication and public key cryptography, storing personally identifiable information, such as biometric data, locally on a FIDO-supported security key.

Because your data is stored locally, you're prompted to insert and touch your personal security key device during sign-in.
