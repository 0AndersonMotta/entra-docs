# Set up your two-factor verification methods overview

Your organization has turned on two-factor verification, meaning that your work or school account sign-in now requires a combination of your username, your password, and a mobile device or phone. Your organization turned on this extra verification because it's more secure than just a password, relying on two forms of authentication: something you know and something you have with you. Two-factor verification can help to prevent malicious hackers from pretending to be you, because even if they have your password, odds are that they don't have your device, too.

If you're having problems with two-factor verification and your personal Microsoft account, the account you set up for yourself (for example, danielle@outlook.com), see [Turning two-factor verification on or off for your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028586/microsoft-account-turning-two-step-verification-on-or-off).

## Access the Additional security verification page

After your organization turns on and sets up two-factor verification, youâ€™ll get a prompt telling you to provide more information to help keep your account secure.

### To access the Additional security verification page

1. Select **Next** from the **More information required** prompt.

    The **Additional security verification** page appears.

2. From the **Additional security verification** page, you must decide which two-factor verification method to use to verify you are who you say you are after signing into your work or school account. You can select:

    - **Mobile device.** You can set up your mobile device to get either phone calls or text messages for two-factor verification.

    - **Office phone.** You can set up your office phone to get either phone calls or text messages for two-factor verification.

    - **Authenticator app.** You can set up an authenticator app, such as Microsoft Authenticator app, to get either notifications or to provide codes, for two-factor verification.

## Next steps

After you've accessed the **Additional security verification** page, you must select and set up your two-factor verification method:
