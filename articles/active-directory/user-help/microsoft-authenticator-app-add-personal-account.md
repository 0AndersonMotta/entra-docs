# Add your personal accounts
You can add your personal Microsoft and non-Microsoft accounts, such as for Outlook.com, Xbox LIVE, Google, Facebook, and more to the Microsoft Authenticator app for two-factor verification.

>[!Important]
>Before you can add your account, you have to download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app. If you haven't done that yet, follow the steps in the [Download and install the app](microsoft-authenticator-app-how-to.md) article.

## Add personal accounts
Generally, for all of your personal accounts, you'll need to:

1. Turn on two-factor verification within your personal app account, either on your device or your PC.

2. Add the account to the Microsoft Authenticator app.

We're providing the process here for your personal Microsoft apps, along with your Facebook, Google, and Apple accounts, but this process is the same for any other app, such as Instagram, Adobe, and so on.

## Add your personal Microsoft account
You can add your personal Microsoft account by first turning on two-factor verification, and then by adding the account to the app.

### Turn on two-factor verification

1. On your PC, go to your [Security basics](https://account.microsoft.com/security) page and sign-in using your personal Microsoft account. For example, alain@outlook.com.

2. At the bottom of the **Security basics** page, choose the **more security options** link.
