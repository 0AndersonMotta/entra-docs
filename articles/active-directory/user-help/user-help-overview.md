## Two-step verification

You've gotten an email from someone in IT or your boss saying that the organization has added additional security verification to your account. So what does that mean? It means your organization is taking extra steps to make sure you are who you say you are when you sign in. This extra verification, also known as two-step verification, is done through a combination of your user name, your password, and a mobile device or phone.

Two-step verification is more secure than just a password because it relies on two forms of authentication: something you know, and something you have with you. The something you know is your password. The something you have with you is a phone or device that you commonly have with you. Two-step verification helps to stop malicious hackers from pretending to be you, because even if they have your password, odds are that they don't have your device, too.
