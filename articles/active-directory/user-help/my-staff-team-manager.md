# Delegate user management with My staff (preview)

**My staff** enables administrators to delegate user management tasks to work team managers, such as store managers, to help their team members access the applications that they need to be productive. When a team member can't access an application because they forgot their password, productivity is lost. Not only does this impact team productivity, but it drives up helpdesk costs and causes a bottleneck in the organizational structure.  With My Staff, a user who can't access their account can regain access in just a couple of clicks, with no helpdesk or IT staff required.

## Manage your staff in My Staff

Accessing your staff and locations (if you manage more than one) is simple. You can [open My staff](https://aka.ms/mystaff). If you manage more than one location or group of users, the first time you visit My staff you must select a location to see the list of users who are part of your location or group.

Locations and the users in a location are determined by your IT administrator and you cannot change them.

## Reset a user password

If your organization has given you the appropriate permissions, you can reset password for your staff members.

1. [Open My staff](https://aka.ms/mystaff).
1. In the **Apps** menu, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Reset password**.
1. Select one or more users, and touch **Select**.
1. Generate or enter the new password, 
You might be shown an automatically generated temporary password or you might be asked to enter a temporary password for the user.

After you have reset the user's password, give the user the temporary password. When the user signs in with their temporary password, they are required to change it.

<!-- ## Manage a user's phone number (coming soon)

If your organization has given you the appropriate permissions, you can manage phone numbers for your staff members. To do this, first select a user.

If the user doesn't have a phone number set up, choose the plus icon to add a phone number for them. Once you set up a phone number for a user, they can use it to sign in with SMS, perform two-step verification, or reset their password on their own, depending on your organization's settings.

If the user has a phone number and needs to change it, choose the pencil icon and enter their new number.

If the user no longer has the phone number that was set up for them, choose the trashcan icon.
