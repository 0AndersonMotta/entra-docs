# Change your work or school account password from the My Account portal

From the **Change password** page of the **My Account** portal, you can update your work or school account password. This will only work if you know your existing password and if you aren't locked out of your account.

>[!Note]
>If you're trying to get back into a personal account like for Xbox, hotmail.com, or outlook.com, try the suggestions in the [When you can't sign in to your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12429/microsoft-account-sign-in-cant) article.

## To change your password from the My Account portal

1. Sign in to your work or school account, using your existing password, and then go to your https://myprofile.microsoft.com/ page.

2. Select the **Change password** link from the **Password** block.
