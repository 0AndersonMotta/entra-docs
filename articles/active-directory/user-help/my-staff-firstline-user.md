# Administrative units management in Azure Active Directory (preview)

The goal of My Staff is to enable firstline worker productivity. This is accomplished by empowering figures of authority, such as a store manager, to ensure that their staff or team members can access the applications that they need to do work and be productive. When a firstline worker can’t access an application because they forgot their password, productivity is lost. Not only does this impact user productivity, but it drives up helpdesk costs and causes a bottleneck in the organizational structure.  With My Staff, a user who can’t access their account can re-gain access in just a couple of clicks – no helpdesk or IT staff required. 

## Manage your staff in My Staff

Accessing your staff and locations (if you manage more than one) is simple. You can go directly to My staff at aka.ms/mystaff.

If you manage more than one location or group of users, you’ll be presented with a list of locations/groups the first time you visit My staff. Select a location to see the list of users who are part of that location. 

 
Note that the locations and the users in a location are determined by your IT administrator and you cannot change them.

## Reset a user’s password
If your organization has given you the appropriate permissions, you can reset password for your staff members. To do this, first select a user.

 

Next, choose “Reset password”. Depending on the user, you may be shown an automatically generated temporary password or you may be asked to enter a temporary password for that user. 

 
 

Once you have reset the user’s password, give the user the temporary password. When that user signs in with the temporary password, they will be asked to change it to a password that only they know.

## Manage a user’s phone number (coming soon)

If your organization has given you the appropriate permissions, you can manage phone numbers for your staff members. To do this, first select a user.

If the user doesn’t have a phone number set up, choose the plus icon to add a phone number for them. Once you set up a phone number for a user, they can use it to sign in with SMS, perform two-step verification, or reset their password on their own, depending on your organization’s settings.

If the user has a phone number and needs to change it, choose the pencil icon and enter their new number.

If the user no longer has the phone number that was set up for them, choose the trashcan icon.
