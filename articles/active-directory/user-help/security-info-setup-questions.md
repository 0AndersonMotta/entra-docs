# Set up security info to use pre-defined security questions (preview)

[!INCLUDE[preview-notice](../../../includes/active-directory-end-user-preview-notice-security-info.md)]

Setting up your security info verification method requires you to sign in to your work or school account and then complete the registration process. If you've never set up your verification methods, you'll be asked to do it now.

You have options for how your organization contacts you to verify your identity, based on what's you're trying to do. The options include:

- **Security questions.** Answer some security questions created by your administrator for your organization for self-service password reset. For step-by-step instructions about how to set up your security questions, see the [Set your verification method to use security questions](#set-your-verification-method-to-use-security-questions) section of this article.

- **Authenticator app.** Download and use an authenticator app to get either an approval notification or a randomly generated approval code for two-step verification or self-service password reset verification. For step-by-step instructions about how to verify your identity with the Microsoft Authenticator app, see the [Set your security info to use an authenticator app](security-info-setup-auth-app.md) article.

- **Mobile device text.** Enter your mobile device number and get a text a code you'll use for two-step verification or self-service password reset verification. For step-by-step instructions about how to verify your identity with a text message (SMS), see the [Set up your security info to use a text message](security-info-setup-text-msg.md) article.

- **Mobile device or work phone call.** Enter your mobile or work phone number to get a verification call or text message for two-step verification or self-service password reset verification. For step-by-step instructions about how to verify your identity with a phone number, see the [Set up your security info to use a phone number](security-info-setup-phone-number.md) article.

- **Email address.** Enter your work or school email address to get a verification email for self-service password reset. For step-by-step instructions about how to set up your email verification, see the [Set up your security info to use email](security-info-setup-email.md) article.

>[!Note]
>If some of these options are missing, it's most likely because your organization doesn't allow those methods for secondary verification. If this is the case, you'll need to choose an available verification method or contact your administrator for more help.

## Set up security questions

Your security info is updated to use several pre-defined questions set up by your administrator to verify your identity when using two-step verification.

### To choose and answer your security questions

Follow this process to choose and answer your security questions. The number of questions you have to answer is determined by your administrator.

1. Sign in to your work or school account.

    The **More information required** box appears.

    Depending on your organization, you might be allowed to wait 14 days before adding your security info. If you don't see this option, it means that it's not available.

2. Select **Next** to begin setting up your security info.

    >If you don't see the security questions option, it's possible that your organization doesn't allow you to use this method for verification. If this is the case, you'll need to choose another verification method or contact your administrator for more help.
