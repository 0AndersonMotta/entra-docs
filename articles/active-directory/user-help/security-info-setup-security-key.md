# Set up security info to use a security key (Preview)

You can use security keys as a passwordless sign-in method within your organization. A security key is a physical device that's used with a unique PIN to sign-in to your work or school account. Because security keys require you to have the physical device and something only you know, it's considered a stronger authentication method than a username and password.

>[!Important]
>This content is intended for users. If you're an administrator, you can find more information about how to set up and manage your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) environment in the [Azure Active Directory Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory).

## What is a security key?

We currently support several designs and providers of security keys using the [Fast Identity Online (FIDO)](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/) (FIDO2) passwordless authentication method. This method allows you to sign in to your work or school account once to get access to all of your organization's cloud-based resources and supported browsers.

Your administrator or your organization will provide you with a security key if they require it for your work or school account. There are different types of security keys you can use, for example a USB key that you plug in to your device or a NFC key that you tap on an NFC reader. You can find out more information about your security key, including what type it is, from the manufacturer's documentation.

> [!Note]
> If you're unable to use a FIDO2 security key, there are other passwordless authentication methods you can use such as the Microsoft Authenticator app or Windows Hello. For more information about the Microsoft Authenticator app, see [What is the Microsoft Authenticator app?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/user-help/user-help-auth-app-overview). For more information about Windows Hello, see [Windows Hello overview](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-hello).

## Supported configurations

If this feature is turned on by your administrator and organization during our public preview, you can use security keys with your work or school account, on devices running Windows 10, version 1903 or higher and the Microsoft Edge browser.

## Before you begin

Before you start to register your security key, double-check that:

- Your administrator has turned on this feature for use within your organization.

- You've received a physical security key from your administrator or your organization. Your security key must be both FIDO2 and Microsoft-compliant. If you have any questions about your security key and whether it's compatible, contact your organization's help desk.

## How to register your security key

You must prepare your security key to work with Windows and a unique PIN before you can sign in to your work or school account using the key.

1. Go to the **My Profile** page at https://myprofile.microsoft.com and sign in if you haven't already done so.

2. Select **Security Info** from the left navigation pane.

3. From the **Security info** page, select **Add method**, and then select **Security key** from the **Add a method** drop-down list.

4. Select **Add**, and then select the type of security key you have, either **USB device** or **NFC device**.

    >[!Note]
    >If you aren't sure which type of security key you have, refer to the manufacturer's documentation. If you aren't sure about the manufacturer, contact your organization's help desk for assistance.

5. Have your security key physically available and then in the **Security key** box, select **Next**.

    A new box appears to help walk you through setting up your new sign-in method.

6. In the **Setting up your new sign-in method** box, select **Next**, and then:

    - If your security key is a USB device, insert your security key into the USB port of your device.

    - If your security key is a NFC device, tap your security key to your reader.

7. Type your unique security key PIN into the **Windows security** box, and then select **OK**.

    You'll return to the **Setting up your new sign-in method** box.

8. Select **Next**.

9. Return to the **Security info** page, type a name you'll recognize later for your new security key, and then select **Next**.

    Your security key is registered and ready for you to use for sign in to your work or school account.

10. Select **Done** to close the **Security key** box.

## Delete a security key from your security info

If you no longer want to use your security key, you can delete the key from your security info. While this stops the security key from being used with your work or school account, the security key continues to store your data and credential information. To delete your data and credential information from the security key itself, you must follow the instructions in the [Reset a Microsoft-compatible security key](#reset-a-microsoft-compatible-security-key) section of this article.

1. Select the **Delete** link from the security key to remove.

2. Select **Ok** from the **Delete security key** box.

    Your security key is deleted and you'll no longer be able to use it to sign in to your work or school account.

>[!Important]
>If you deleted this security key by mistake, you'll have to register it again using the instructions in the [How to register your security key](#how-to-register-your-security-key) section of this article.

## Manage your security key settings from Windows Settings

You can manage your security key settings from the **Windows Settings** app, including resetting your security key and creating a new security key PIN.

### Reset your security key

If you want to delete all the account information stored on your physical security key, you must return the key back to its factory defaults. Resetting your security key deletes everything from the key, allowing you to start over.
