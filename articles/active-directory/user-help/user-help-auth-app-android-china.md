# Microsoft Authenticator for Android in the public cloud in China

The Microsoft Authenticator app for Android is available for download in China. Because the Google Play Store isn't available in China, the app must be downloaded from other Chinese app marketplaces. The Microsoft Authenticator app for Android is currently available in the following stores in China:

- [Baidu](https://shouji.baidu.com/software/26638379.html)
- [Lenovo](https://www.lenovomm.com/appdetail/com.azure.authenticator/20197724)
- [Huawei](https://appgallery.cloud.huawei.com/uowap/index.html#/detailApp/C100262999?source=appshare&subsource=C100262999&shareTo=weixin&locale=zh_CN)
- [Samsung Galaxy Store](http://apps.samsung.com/appquery/appDetail.as?appId=com.azure.authenticator)

The most current build of the app is in the Google Play Store, but we're making best efforts to update the app on all other app stores. Because there is no custom Android application package (APK) deployed to any app store, the app can be seamlessly updated either from the store it was downloaded from or the Google Play Store if the user crosses regions.

## Limitations

The Microsoft Authenticator app for Android uses Googleâ€™s Firebase Cloud Messaging system and Google Play Services to receive push notifications. Because neither service is available in China, there are some limitations in functionalities of the app:

- Registration of the Authenticator app as a multi-factor authentication authentication method using push notifications will not work.

- [Phone sign-in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/user-help/howto-authentication-sms-signin) can't be set up because it requires the user to set up the app as an multi-factor authentication method capable of receiving push notifications, which currently don't work.

If a user has previously managed to set up phone sign-in or multi-factor authentication using the app, they will be able to perform a manual check for notifications requests in the app and use it for identity verification.

## Multi-factor authentication

Instead of using push notifications for multi-factor authentication, users can set up their multi-factor authentication to receive verification codes they can use to verify their identity. These verification codes are valid for 30 seconds and to use them, admins must enable their tenant to perform verification using Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) verification codes.
