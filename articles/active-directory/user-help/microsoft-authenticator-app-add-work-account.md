# Add your work or school account
You can add your work or school account, given to you by your organization, to the Microsoft Authenticator app for two-factor verification.

>[!Important]
>Before you can add your account, you have to download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app. If you haven't done that yet, follow the steps in the [Download and install the app](microsoft-authenticator-app-how-to.md) article.

## Add your work or school account

1. On your PC, go to the [Additional security verification](https://aka.ms/mfasetup) page.

    >[!Note]
    >If you don't see the **Additional security verification** page, it's possible that your administrator has turned on the security info preview experience. If that's the case, you should follow the instructions in the [Set up security info to use an authenticator app](security-info-setup-auth-app.md) section. If that's not the case, you will need to contact your organization's Help Desk for assistance. For more information about security info, see [Manage your security info](security-info-manage-settings.md).

2. Check the box next to **Authenticator app**, and then select **Configure**.

    The **Configure mobile app** page appears.

3. Open the Microsoft Authenticator app, select **Add account** from the **Customize and control** icon in the upper-right, and then select **Work or school account**.

4. Use your device's camera to scan the QR code from the **Configure mobile app** screen on your PC, and then choose **Done**.

    >[!Note]
    >If your camera isn't working properly, you can [enter the QR code and URL manually](#add-an-account-to-the-app-manually).

5. Review the **Accounts** screen of the app on your device, to make sure your account is right and that there's an associated six-digit verification code. For additional security, the verification code changes every 30 seconds preventing you from using the same code twice.
