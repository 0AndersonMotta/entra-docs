# Manage your connected devices from the My Account portal

From the **Devices** page of the **My account portal**, you can:

- View your work or school account-connected devices.

- Disable any devices you no longer own, have lost, or that have been stolen.

## View your connected devices

1. Sign in to your work or school account and then go to your https://myprofile.microsoft.com/ page.

2. Select **Devices** from the left navigation pane or select the **Manage devices** link from the **Devices** block.

3. Review the information for your connected devices, making sure you recognize them all.

## Disable a device

You can disable any of your connected devices at any time. This is especially important if a device isn't familiar to you or if a device is lost or stolen. After you disable a device, it can no longer be authenticated by your organization, and will be unable to access any of your organization's resources.

>[!Important]
>If you disable a device by mistake, there's no way to undo it. You'll have to contact your organization's administrator to add the device again.

1. Select **Disable** from the device you want to remove.

2. Select **Yes** to confirm you want to disable the device.

## View a BitLocker key <!--Need images and to update from them-->

If you're locked out of your device or have a fatal error, you can go to another device and view your BitLocker key from the **My Account** portal.

1. On another device, where you're not locked out, go to the **Devices** page of the **My Account** portal.

2. Select **View BitLocker key** for the locked out device.

## Next steps

- After viewing your connected devices, you can select to view or manage your [security info](user-help-security-info-overview.md), your [organizations](my-account-portal-organizations-page.md), or view how your organization [uses your privacy-related data](my-account-portal-privacy-page.md).
