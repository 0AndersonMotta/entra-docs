# Edit or revoke application permissions and saved accounts in the My Apps (preview) portal

When you use organizational applications in the My Apps (preview) portal, you often grant permissions and save account information. To keep your data secure, you may want to review and revoke permissions or clear saved account credentials. Removing permissions or accounts may break some app functionality. If you have problems after you remove permissions or accounts, contact your organization's Helpdesk for additional assistance.

>[!Important]
>This content is intended for users. If you're an administrator, you can find more information about how to set up and manage your cloud-based apps in the [Application Management Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps).

## Manage app permissions

To view the permissions consented to by you or your administrator, choose an app in the My Apps (preview) portal and select **Manage app**.

** SCREENSHOT OF APP MENU **

The top part of permissions window shows what you personally consented to. Examples of apps permissions include the ability to access your calendar, contacts, or camera. You can revoke any of the permissions you consented to, however revoking a permission may break some of the apps functionality.

** SCREENSHOT OF PERMISSIONS PAGE **

The bottom part of the permissions window shows what your administrator consented to on your behalf. This section isn't shown if there are no admin consented permissions. You can't revoke these permissions because the administrator consented to them, and they're often required for your organization's policy.

## Manage saved accounts

Some applications you use may store credentials to sign you into the app. For example, if you want to add Facebook to your My Apps experience and have single sign-in (SSO), you can store your email and password. When you then launch the app from the My Apps (preview) portal, the saved credentials are used to sign in. To add, update, or clear these accounts, select the app and choose **Manage app**, the go to the **Accounts** page.

** SCREENSHOT OF ACCOUNTS PAGE **

A list of all the saved accounts associated with the app is shown. As needed, select and update or remove the saved accounts from the app.

## Next steps

After you manage app permissions and saved accounts in the **My Apps** portal, you can:

- Organize your apps into the various categories created and provided by your organization. For more information, see [Access and use workspaces in the My Apps (preview) portal](my-applications-portal-workspaces.md).

- Request access to additional organizational apps in the My Apps (preview) portal. For more information, see [Add or request access to apps](my-applications-portal-add-apps.md).
