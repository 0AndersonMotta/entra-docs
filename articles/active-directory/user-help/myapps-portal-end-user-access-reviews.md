# Perform an access review from the My Apps portal
You can use your work or school account with the web-based **My Apps** portal, to view and start many of your organization’s cloud-based apps, to update some of your profile and account information, to see your **Groups** information, and to perform access reviews for your apps and groups. If you don’t have access to the **My Apps** portal, you must contact your Helpdesk for permission.

>[!Important]
>This content is intended for users. If you're an administrator, you can find more information about how to set up and manage your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) environment in the [Azure Active Directory Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory).

## View your access review information
If your administrator has given you permission to view the **Access reviews** tile, you can view any access reviews awaiting your approval and you perform the access review.


## Next steps

- [Change your profile information](myapps-portal-end-user-update-profile.md).

- [View and update your groups-related information](myapps-portal-end-user-groups.md).

- Depending on your role and permissions, you may be able to [perform access reviews](myapps-portal-end-user-access-reviews.md) to provide or deny user or group access to your organization's apps.
