# Register your personal device on your organization's network
Register your personal device, typically a phone or tablet, running Windows 10, iOS, Android, or macOS, on your organization's network.

## What happens when you register your device
While you're registering your device on your organization's network, the following actions will happen:

- Windows registers your device on your organization's network.

- You might be asked to set up two-step verification through either [Multi-Factor Authentication](multi-factor-authentication-end-user-first-time.md) or [security info](user-help-security-info-overview.md), depending on what your organization has set up.

- You'll be automatically enrolled in mobile device management, such as Microsoft Intune, if it's necessary. For more info about enrolling in Microsoft Intune, see [Enroll your device in Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune-user-help/enroll-your-device-in-intune-all).

- You'll go through the sign-in process, using the username and password for your personal, non-organizational account.

## To register your device

## Next steps
After you register your personal device to your organization's network, you should be able to access most of your resources.
