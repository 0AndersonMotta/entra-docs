# Set up security info to use email (preview)

[!INCLUDE[preview-notice](../../../includes/active-directory-end-user-preview-notice-security-info.md)]

Setting up your security info verification method requires you to sign in to your work or school account and then complete the registration process. If you've never set up your verification methods, you'll be asked to do it now.

You have options for how your organization contacts you to verify your identity, based on what's you're trying to do. The options include:

- **Email address.** Enter your work or school email address to get a verification email for self-service password reset. For step-by-step instructions about how to set up your email verification, see the [Set your verification method to your email address](#set-your-verification-method-to-your-email-address) section of this article.

- **Authenticator app.** Download and use an authenticator app to get either an approval notification or a randomly generated approval code for two-step verification or self-service password reset verification. For step-by-step instructions about how to verify your identity with the Microsoft Authenticator app, see the [Set your security info to use an authenticator app](security-info-setup-auth-app.md) article.

- **Mobile device text.** Enter your mobile device number and get a text a code you'll use for two-step verification or self-service password reset verification. For step-by-step instructions about how to verify your identity with a text message (SMS), see the [Set up your security info to use a text message](security-info-setup-text-msg.md) article.

- **Mobile device or work phone call.** Enter your mobile or work phone number to get a verification call or text message for two-step verification or self-service password reset verification. For step-by-step instructions about how to verify your identity with a phone number, see the [Set up your security info to use a phone number](security-info-setup-phone-number.md) article.

- **Security questions.** Answer some security questions created by your administrator for your organization for self-service password reset. For step-by-step instructions about how to set up your security questions, see the [Set up your security info to use security questions](security-info-setup-questions.md) article.

>[!Note]
>If some of these options are missing, it's most likely because your organization doesn't allow those methods for secondary verification. If this is the case, you'll need to choose an available verification method or contact your administrator for more help.
