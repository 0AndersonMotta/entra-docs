# Set up an Authenticator app as your two-factor verification method

You can set up an authenticator app to send a notification to your mobile device or to send you a verification code as your security verification method. You aren't required to use the Microsoft Authenticator app, and you can select a different app during the set up process. However, this article uses the Microsoft Authenticator app.

>[!Important]
>Before you can add your account, you must download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app. If you haven't done that yet, follow the steps in the [Download and install the app](user-help-auth-app-download-install.md) article.

>[!Note]
> If the Mobile app option is greyed out, it's possible that your organization doesn't allow you to use an authentication app for verification. In this case, you'll need to select another method or contact your administrator for more help.
