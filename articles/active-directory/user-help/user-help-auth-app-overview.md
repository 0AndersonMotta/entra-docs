# Microsoft Authenticator app overview

>[!Important]
>This content is intended for users. If you're an administrator, you can find more information about how to set up and manage your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) environment in the [Azure Active Directory Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory).

The Microsoft Authenticator app helps you prove your identity without needing to remember a password. Instead of a password, your sign-in using your username and your mobile device with your fingerprint, face, or PIN to confirm that you are in fact, you. Two-factor verification is considered more secure than just a password, especially while viewing sensitive info.

>[!NOTE]
>If you're having issues signing in to your account, see [When you can't sign in to your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12429) for help.  Get more info about what to do when you receive the [“That Microsoft account doesn't exist”](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13811) message when you try to sign in to your Microsoft account.

## Terminology
|Term|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Two-factor verification |A verification process that requires you to specifically use only two pieces of verification info, like a password and a PIN. The Microsoft Authenticator app uses this form of verification.|
|Multi-factor authentication (MFA)|All two-factor verification is multi-factor authentication, requiring you to use *at least* two pieces of verification info, based on your organization's requirements.|
|Microsoft account (also called, MSA)|You create your own personal accounts, to get access to your consumer-oriented Microsoft products and cloud services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Xbox LIVE, or Office 365. Your Microsoft account is created and stored in the Microsoft consumer identity account system that's run by Microsoft.|
|Work or school account|Your organization creates your work or school account (such as alain@contoso.com) to let you access internal and potentially restricted resources, such as Microsoft Azure, Windows Intune, and Office 365.|

## How this feature works
Two-factor verification specifically works in one of two ways:

- **Notification.** The Microsoft Authenticator app sends a notification asking you to **Approve sign-in**. Choose **Approve** if you recognize the sign-in attempt. Otherwise, choose **Deny**. If you choose **Deny**, you can also mark the request as fraudulent.

- **Verification code.** Type in your username and password for either your work or school account or your personal Microsoft account, and then copy the associated verification code from the **Accounts** screen of the Microsoft Authenticator app.

### Whether to use your device's biometric capabilities
If your organization requires you to use a PIN to complete the authentication process, you can set up the Microsoft Authenticator app to instead use your device's fingerprint or facial recognition (biometric) capabilities. You can set this up the first time you use the authenticator app to verify your account, by selecting the option to use your device biometric capabilities as identification instead of your PIN.

## Who decides if you use this feature?
Depending on your account type, your organization might decide that you have to use two-factor verification, or you might be able to decide for yourself.

- **Work or school account.** If you're using a work or school account (for example, alain@contoso.com), it's up to your organization whether you must use two-factor verification, along with the specific verification methods. For more information about multi-factor verification, see [What does Azure Multi-Factor Authentication mean for me](multi-factor-authentication-end-user.md). For more information about how to set up Security info to use the Microsoft Authentication app, see [Set up security info to use an authenticator app (preview)](security-info-setup-auth-app.md).

- **Personal Microsoft account.** You can choose to set up two-factor verification for your personal Microsoft accounts (for example, alain@outlook.com).

- **Non-Microsoft personal account.** You can choose to set up two-factor verification for your non-Microsoft personal accounts (for example, alain@gmail.com). Your non-Microsoft accounts might not use the term, two-factor verification, but you should be able to find the feature within the **Security** or the **Sign-in** settings.
