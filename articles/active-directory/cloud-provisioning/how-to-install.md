### Azure portal agent verification
To verify the agent is being seen by Azure, follow these steps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
1. On the left, select **Azure Active Directory** > **Azure AD Connect**. In the center, select **Manage provisioning (preview)**.

### On the local server
To verify that the agent is running, follow these steps.

1.  Sign in to the server with an administrator account.
1.  Open **Services** by either navigating to it or by going to **Start** > **Run** > **Services.msc**.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The agent has been installed but it must be configured and enabled before it will start synchronizing users. To configure a new agent, see [Create a new configuration for Azure AD Connect cloud-based provisioning](how-to-configure.md).

## Group Managed Service Accounts
A group Managed Service Account is a managed domain account that provides automatic password management, simplified service principal name (SPN) management,the ability to delegate the management to other administrators, and also extends this functionality over multiple servers.  Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync supports and recommends the use of a group Managed Service Account for running the agent.  For more information on a gMSA, see [Group Managed Service Accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview) 


### Installation using a gMSA account
These installation instructions are for a brand new installation.  If you are upgrading an existing agent and want to switch to using a gMSA account, see [Upgrading and switching to a gMSA account](#upgrading-and-switching-to-a-gMSA-account).

1.	Run agent MSI. This will open the Azure AD Connect Provisioning Agent Wizard.
2.	Enter your Azure AD global administrator credentials in the Connect Azure AD page.
3.	Enter your EA/DA of all the domains you want to sync in the Connect Active Directory page.
4.	Enter your EA/DA of current domain where agent is installed in the Configure Service Account page
5.	Click Confirm in the Confirm page.


### Upgrading and switching to a gMSA account

1.	Run agent MSI. This will update the agent service to the latest version.
2.	Double-click the **Azure AD Connect Provisioning Agent** wizard.
3.	Enter your Azure AD global administrator credentials in the Connect Azure AD page.
4.	Enter your EA/DA of all the domains you want to sync in the Connect Active Directory page.
5.	Enter your EA/DA of current domain where agent is installed in the Configure Service Account page.
6.	Click Confirm in the Confirm page.
