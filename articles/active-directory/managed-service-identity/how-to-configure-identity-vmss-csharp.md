# Configure a VM Managed Service Identity (MSI) using C#

Managed Service Identity provides Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory. You can use this identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, without having credentials in your code. 

In this article, you learn how to enable and remove MSI for an Azure VM, using C#.

## Prerequisites

If you're unfamiliar with MSI, check out the [Managed Service Identity overview](overview.md). If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) before continuing.

If you are unfamiliar with creating an Azure VMSS using C#, see the following:

- [Manage Virtual Machine Scale Set](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/compute-dotnet-manage-virtual-machine-scale-sets)

## Enable Managed Identity during the creation of an Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set

To enable Managed Identity during the creation of an Azure VMSS, add the line `.WithSystemAssignedManagedServiceIdentity()` as seen in the following code sample:  

```csharp
var virtualMachineScaleSet = azure.VirtualMachineScaleSets.Define("myVM")
    // code for other configuration settings
    .WithSystemAssignedManagedServiceIdentity()
    .Create();

```  
## Enable managed identity for an Azure VM

To enable Managed identity on an existing VM, refer to the following code sample:

```csharp
virtualMachineScaleSet.Update()
    //code for other configuration updates
    .WithSystemAssignedManagedServiceIdentity()
    .Apply();

```

## Remove MSI from an Azure VM

To remove Managed Identity on an existing VM, refer to the following code sample:

```csharp



```
