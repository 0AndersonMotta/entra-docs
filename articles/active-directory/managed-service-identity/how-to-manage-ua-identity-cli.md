# Create, list and delete a user assigned Managed Service Identity (MSI) using Azure CLI

[!INCLUDE[preview-notice](~/includes/active-directory-msi-preview-notice-ua.md)]

Managed Service Identity provides Azure services with a managed identity in Azure Active Directory. You can use this identity to authenticate to services that support Azure AD authentication, without needing credentials in your code. 

In this article, you learn how to create, list and delete a user assigned identity using Azure CLI.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [msi-core-prereqs](~/includes/active-directory-msi-core-prereqs-ua.md)]

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

To run the CLI script examples in this tutorial, you have two options:

- Use [Azure Cloud Shell](~/articles/cloud-shell/overview.md) either from the Azure portal, or via the "Try It" button, located in the top right corner of each code block.
- [Install the latest version of CLI 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) (2.0.23 or later) if you prefer to use a local CLI console. Then sign in to Azure using [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az_login). Use an account that is associated with the Azure subscription under which you would like to deploy the user-assigned identity and VM:

   ```azurecli
   az login
   ```

## Create a user assigned managed identity 

To create a user assigned managed identity, use the [az identity create](/cli/azure/identity#az-identity-create) command. The `-g` parameter specifies the resource group where to create the user assigned identity, and the `-n` parameter specifies its name. Replace the `<RESOURCE GROUP>` and `<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>` parameter values with your own values:

 ```azurecli-interactive
az identity create -g <RESOURCE GROUP> -n <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>
```
## List user assigned identities

To list managed service identities, use the [az identity list](/cli/azure/identity#az-identity-list) command.  The `-g` parameter specifies the resource group where the user assigned identity was created.  Replace the `<RESOURCE GROUP>` with your own value:

```azurecli-interactive
az identity list -g <RESOURCE GROUP>
```
In the json response, user assigned identities have `"Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities"` value returned for key, `type`.

`"type": "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities"`

## Delete a user assigned identity

To delete a user assigned MSI, use the [az identity delete](/cli/azure/identity#az-identity-delete) command.  The -n parameter specifies its name and the -g parameter specifies the resource group where the user assigned identity was created.  Replace the `<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>` and `<RESOURCE GROUP>` parameters values with your own values:

 ```azurecli-interactive
az identity delete -n <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME> -g <RESOURCE GROUP>
```
