# Delete an Azure Active Directory tenant



All resources





## How to prepare to delete an Azure AD directory
A global administrator can delete an Azure AD directory from the portal. When a directory is deleted, all resources that are contained in the directory are also deleted. Verify that you donâ€™t need the directory before you delete it.

> [!NOTE]
> If the user is signed in with a work or school account, the user must not be attempting to delete their home directory. For example, if the user is signed in as joe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com, that user cannot delete the directory that has contoso.onmicrosoft.com as its default domain.

Azure AD requires that certain conditions are met to delete a directory. This reduces risk that deleting a directory negatively impacts users or applications, such as the ability of users to sign in to Office 365 or access resources in Azure. For example, if a directory for a subscription is unintentionally deleted, then users can't access the Azure resources for that subscription.

The following conditions are checked:

* The only user in the directory should be the global administrator who is to delete the directory. Any other users must be deleted before the directory can be deleted. If users are synchronized from on-premises, then sync must be turned off, and the users must be deleted in the cloud directory by using the Azure portal or Azure PowerShell cmdlets. There is no requirement to delete groups or contacts, such as contacts added from the Office 365 Admin Center.
* There can be no applications in the directory. Any applications must be deleted before the directory can be deleted.
* No multi-factor authentication providers can be linked to the directory.
* There can be no subscriptions for any Microsoft Online Services such as Microsoft Azure, Office 365, or Azure AD Premium associated with the directory. For example, if a default directory was created for you in Azure, you cannot delete this directory if your Azure subscription still relies on this directory for authentication. Similarly, you can't delete a directory if another user has associated a subscription with it.
