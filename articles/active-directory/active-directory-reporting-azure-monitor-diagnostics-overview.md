# Azure Active Directory logs in Azure monitor

You can now route Azure AD audit logs through your own storage account and store the data for as long as you want. With the public preview of this feature, you can:

* Archive your audit logs for an Azure storage account, enabling you to retain the data for a long time
* Stream your audit logs to an Azure event hub for analytics using popular SIEM tools like Splunk and QRadar
* Integrate your audit logs with your own custom log solutions by streaming them to an event hub

## Prerequisites

To use this feature, you need:

* An Azure subscription
* Azure AD Free, Basic, Premium 1, or Premium 2 license to access the Azure AD logs in the Azure portal.

Depending on where you want to route the audit log data, you need either:

* An Azure storage account, with *ListKeys* permissions. We recommend you use a general storage account and not a blob storage account. For pricing information on storage, check out the Azure Pricing Storage calculator. 
* Azure event hubs namespace, in order to integrate with third-party solutions

You need to be a *global admin* or *security admin* in the Azure AD tenant to access the Azure AD activity logs.

## Cost considerations

If you already have an Azure AD license, you need an Azure subscription to set up the storage account and event hub. The Azure subscription comes at no cost, but you have to pay to utilize Azure resources, including the storage account you use for archival and the event hub you use for streaming. The amount of data, and thus the cost incurred, will vary significantly depending on the tenant size. 

### Storage size for audit logs

Every audit log event uses up about 2 KB of data storage. So, for a tenant with 100,000 users, which would incur about 1.5 million events per day, you would need about 3 GB of data storage per day. Since writes occur in approximately 5-min batches, you can anticipate approximately 9000 write operations per month. The following table contains an approximate estimate for the cost, depending on the size of the tenant, for a general-purpose v2 storage account in West US for at least one year of retention. Use the [Azure storage pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/) to create a more accurate estimate for the data volume you anticipate for your application.

| Log category | Number of users | Number of events/day | Approximate volume of data per month | Approximate cost per month | Approximate cost per year |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Audit | 100,000 | 1.5 million | 90 GB | $1.93 | $23.12 |
| Audit | 1000 | 15000 | 900 MB | $0.02 | $0.24 |
| Sign-ins | 100,000 |


### Event hub messages for logs

Events are batched into approximately five-minute intervals and sent as a single message containing all the events within that timeframe. A message in the event hub has a maximum size of 256 kB, and if the size of all the messages within the timeframe exceeds that volume, multiple messages are sent. 

For example, there are typically about 18 events per second for a large tenant of more than 100,000 users, equating to 5400 events every 5 minutes. Since audit logs are about 2 KB per event, this equates to 10.8 MB of data, therefore 43 messages will be sent to the event hub in that 5-minute interval. The following table contains an approximate cost for a basic event hub in West US, depending on the volume of event data. Use the [Event Hub pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/event-hubs/) to calculate an accurate estimate for the data volume that you anticipate for your application.

| Log category | Number of users | Number of events/second | Number of events per 5-minute interval | Volume per interval | Number of messages per interval | Number of messages per month | Approximate cost per month |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Audit | 100,000 | 18 | 5400 | 10.8 MB | 43 | 371,520 | $10.83 |
| Audit | 1000 | 0.1 | 52 | 104 KB | 1 | 8640 | $10.8 |
| Sign-ins | 100,000 |
