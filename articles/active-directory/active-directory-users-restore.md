# Restore a deleted user in Azure Active Directory

When you delete a user in the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), the deleted group is retained but not visible for 30 days from the deletion date. This is so that the user and its properties can be restored if needed. 

## Reuired permissions
The permissions required to restore a group can be any of the following:

Role  | Permissions 
--------- | ---------
Company Administrator, Partner Tier2 support, and InTune Service Admins | Can restore any deleted user 
User Account Administrator and Partner Tier1 support | Can restore any deleted user except those assigned to the Company Administrator role

## How to restore a deleted user
In the Azure portal, you can now
* Restore a deleted user 
* Permanently delete a user 

1. In the [Azure AD admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com), select **Users and groups** &gt; **All users**. 
2. Under **Show**, filter the page to show **Recently deleted users**. 
3. Select one or more recently deleted users.
4. Select **Restore user** or **Delete permanently**.
