# An Application Proxy application takes too long to load

This article helps you to understand why an Azure AD Application Proxy application may take a long time to load. It also explains what you can do to resolve this issue.

## Overview
If your applications are working but you see a long latency, there may be some minor tweaks in your network topology that you can consider to improve the speed. For an evaluation of different topologies, see the [network considerations document](application-proxy-network-topology-considerations.md).

Besides network topology, there are currently no further recommendations for for performance tuning. As the Application Proxy service expands to more data centers that may be closer to you, you may start to see improved latency directly. To see the full list of Azure data centers, you can see the [latency test page](http://www.azurespeed.com/Azure/Latency). 

The data centers with the Application Proxy service can be found with the [Connector Ports Test Tool](https://aadap-portcheck.connectorporttest.msappproxy.net/). 

## Feedback on Application Proxy data center locations 
There may be Azure data centers that donâ€™t yet include Application Proxy, but would lead to a great latency improvement for you. Send the data center location to <aadapfeedback@microsoft.com>, so we can use your feedback to plan as we expand.

Microsoft is working on additional capabilities to help improve the latency for tenants that currently see long latencies, and will share the documentation once available.
