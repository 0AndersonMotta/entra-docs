# Migrate classic policies in the Azure portal 

If you have conditional access policies in the Azure classic portal configured, you should migrate them to the Azure portal because:

- The policies you have configured in the Azure classic portal continue to work until you disable or migrate them. 

- A user who is in an Azure classic portal policy and an Azure portal policy needs to meet the requirements in both policies.

- If you don't migrate your existing policies, you are not be able to implement policies that are granting access.

This topic provides you with information about the related policy migration steps.

## Classic policies

The conditional access policies you have configured in the Azure classic portal are also known as **classic policies**. To migrate your classic policies, you don't need to have access to your Azure classic portal. The Azure portal provides you with a [**Classic policies (preview)** view](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ConditionalAccessBlade/ClassicPolicies) that enables you to review your classic policies.

### Open a classic policy

**To open a classic policy:**

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), on the left navbar, click **Azure Active Directory**.

    ![Azure Active Directory](./media/active-directory-conditional-access-migration/01.png)

2. On the **Azure Active Directory** page, in the **Manage** section, click **Conditional access**.

2. On the **Conditional access - Policies** page, in the **Manage** section, click **Classic policies (preview)**.

3. From the list of classic policies, select the policy you care about.

## Azure AD conditional access policies

This topic provides you with detailed steps that enable you to migrate your classic policies without being familiar with Azure AD conditional access polices. However, being familiar with the basic concepts and terminology of Azure AD conditional access helps to improve your migration experience.

See:

- [Conditional access in Azure Active Directory](active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal.md) to learn about the basic concepts and the terminology

- [Get started with conditional access in Azure Active Directory](active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal-get-started.md) to familiarize yourself with the user interface in the Azure portal


 


## What you should know 

- Classic policies configured for device and app (mobile app management) based controls work like multiple controls with one selected control to be required (OR).  

- Classic policies for app based controls apply only to **Office 365 Exchange Online** and **Office 365 SharePoint Online**. 

- Policies configured with classic controls and the new Azure portal controls work like separate multiple policies where all selected controls need to be fulfilled (AND).  

- The **Office 365 Exchange online** cloud app requires 2 policies if youâ€™re looking to support all supported client apps (browser, modern authentication clients and Exchange Active Sync apps).  

- Classic policies for app-based controls are pre-configured for iOS and Android only. New Azure portal requires you to pick the device platform explicitly. 

- Classic policies for app-based controls for Office 365 Exchange Online are configured to allow supported and unsupported platforms for Exchange ActiveSync. 


## Multi-factor authentication policy 

This example shows how to migrate a classic policy that requires multi-factor authentication** for a cloud app.
