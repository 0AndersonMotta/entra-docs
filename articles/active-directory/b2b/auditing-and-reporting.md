# Auditing and reporting a B2B collaboration user
With guest users, you have auditing capabilities similar to with member users. 

## Access reviews
Use access reviews to periodically verify whether guest users still need access to your resources. Use the **Access reviews** feature in the Azure Active Directory portal by going to either **Security** > **Conditional Access** or **Manage** > **Organizational Relationships**. For details about conducting access reviews, see [Manage guest access with Azure AD access reviews](../governance/manage-guest-access-with-access-reviews.md).

## Audit logs

Here's an example of the invitation and redemption history of invitee Sam Oogle:

![audit log](./media/auditing-and-reporting/audit-log.png)

You can dive into each of these events to get the details. For example, let's look at the acceptance details.

![activity details](./media/auditing-and-reporting/activity-details.png)

You can also export these logs from Azure AD and use the reporting tool of your choice to get customized reports.
