# Self-service for Azure AD B2B collaboration sign-up

Customers can do a lot with the built-in features that are exposed through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and the [Application Access Panel](https://myapps.microsoft.com) for end users. However, you might need to customize the onboarding workflow for B2B users to fit your organizationâ€™s needs.

As an inviting organization, you might not know ahead of time who the individual external collaborators are who need access to your resources. You need a way for users from partner companies to sign themselves up with policies that you control. If you want to enable users from other organizations to request access, and upon approval be provisioned with guest accounts and assigned to groups, apps and SharePoint Online sites, you can use [Azure AD entitlement management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-overview) to configure policies that [manage access for external users](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-external-users#how-access-works-for-external-users).
