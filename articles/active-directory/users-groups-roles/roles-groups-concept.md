# Use groups to manage role assignments in Azure Active Directory (preview)

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is introducing a public preview in which you can assign a role-enabled group to Azure AD built-in roles. Use it, for example, to assign the Helpdesk administrator role to a group of your Tier I helpdesk personnel. When members are added to the group, they are assigned to the role indirectly. Azure AD governance then takes care of the approval process and auditing of the group’s membership to ensure that only legitimate users are member of the group and thus the Helpdesk Administrator role.

You can use groups to grant admin access in Azure AD in a process that requires minimal effort from your Global administrators or Privileged role administrators who might have other pressing things to take care of.

## How this feature works

Create a new Office 365 or security group with the ‘isAssignableToRole’ property set to ‘true’. You can enable this property in UI by switching on the toggle ‘enabled for role assignment’ when creating a new group. More details in subsequent sections. Then assign this group to one or more Azure AD roles in the same way as you assign to users.

## Why we enforce creation of a special group for assigning it to a role

Azure AD allows you to protect a group assigned to a role by using a new property called isAssignableToRole for groups. Only cloud groups that had the isAssignableToRole property set to ‘true’ at creation time can be assigned to a role. This property is immutable; once a group is created with this property set to ‘true’, it can’t be changed. You can't set the property on an existing group.

If a group is assigned a role, any IT admin who can manage group membership could also indirectly manage the membership of that role. For example, assume that a group Contoso_User_Administrators is assigned to User account administrator role. An Exchange admin who can modify group membership could add themselves to the Contoso_User_Administrators group and become a User account administrator. As you can see, an admin could elevate their privilege in a way you did not intend. We designed how groups are assigned to roles to prevent that sort of potential breach from happening:

- Only Global Administrator and Privileged Role Administrator can create a group with the "isAssignableToRole" property enabled.
- It can't be an Azure AD dynamic group. It must have a membership type of "Assigned." Automated population of dynamic groups could lead to an unwanted account being added that then could then use the role permissions to manage group membership and thus assignments to the role.
- There can't be an owner of a role-enabled group. Only Global Administrator and Privileged Role Administrator can manage the membership of this group by default. We will bring the ability to delegate the management of such groups to other people in future.
- No nesting. A group can't be added as a member of a role-enable group.

Important: If you use Office 365 groups to assign to roles, they can expire. And because role-enabled  groups can't have owners, the expiration email will be sent to the alternate email address you provide. So, provide an email address that you monitor. Set Office 365 groups to expire in Azure Active Directory. Otherwise use a security group for assigning to roles.

## Required license plan

Using this feature requires an Azure AD Premium P1 license. To find the right license for your requirements, see Comparing generally available features of the Free, Basic, and Premium editions.
