# Assign a role to a group using Privileged Identity Management

This article describes how an IT admin can assign an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) role to a group using Azure AD Privileged Identity Management.

## Using Azure AD Admin Center

1. Open https://aka.ms//assignrolestogroups. Sign in with Privileged role administrator or Global administrator permissions in the Azure AD organization.  

1. Select Privileged Identity Management > Azure AD roles > Roles > Add member

    ![Azure AD roles](./media/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user/roles-list.png)

1. Select the group. Only groups that are eligible for role assignment (the cloud groups created with "Eligible for role assignment") are shown in the list, not all groups.

    ![select the user to whom you're assigning the role](./media/roles-groups-pim-eligible/select-member.png)

1. Select the desired membership setting. For roles requiring activation, choose eligible. By default, the user would be permanently eligible, but you could also set a start and end time for the user’s eligibility. Once you are complete, hit Save and Add to complete the role assignment.

## Using PowerShell

### Download the Azure AD Preview PowerShell module

    #To install the Azure AD #PowerShell module, use the following cmdlets:
    
    install-module azureadpreview 
    import-module azureadpreview 
    
    #To verify that the module is ready to use, use the following cmdlet: 
    
    get-module azureadpreview 
    
    #Assign a group as an eligible member of a role 
    
    $schedule = New-Object Microsoft.Open.MSGraph.Model.AzureADMSPrivilegedSchedule
    $schedule.Type = "Once"     
    $schedule.StartDateTime = "2019-04-26T20:49:11.770Z"
    $schedule.endDateTime = "2019-07-25T20:49:11.770Z"
    Open-AzureADMSPrivilegedRoleAssignmentRequest -ProviderId aadRoles -Schedule $schedule -ResourceId "[YOUR TENANT ID]" -RoleDefinitionId "9f8c1837-f885-4dfd-9a75-990f9222b21d" -SubjectId "[YOUR GROUP ID]" -AssignmentState "Eligible" -Type "AdminAdd" 

## Using Microsoft Graph API

    POST 
    https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/privilegedAccess/aadroles/roleAssignmentRequests  
    
    {
    
     “roleDefinitionId": {roleDefinitionId}, 
    
     “resourceId”: {tenantId}, 
    
     “subjectId”: {GroupId}, 
    
     “assignmentState”: “Eligible”, 
    
     “type”: “AdminAdd”, 
    
     “reason”: “reason string”, 
    
     “schedule”: { 
    
           “startDateTime”: {DateTime}, 
    
           “endDateTime”: {DateTime}, 
    
           “type”: “Once”  
    
     } 
    
    }
