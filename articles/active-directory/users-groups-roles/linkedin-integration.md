# LinkedIn account connections
In this article, you can learn how to enable or disable LinkedIn account connections for your tenant in the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) admin center.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> LinkedIn account connections functionality is currently being rolled out to Azure AD tenants. It is not available for United States government customers or for organizations with Exchange Online mailboxes hosted in Australia, China, Germany, and South Africa. Support for these mailbox locations is coming soon. For an up-to-date view of rollout information,see the [Office 365 Roadmap](https://products.office.com/business/office-365-roadmap?filters=%26freeformsearch=linkedin#abc) page.
>
> The integration works only if you have it enabled *and* if you allow users to consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf. For information about the consent setting, see [How to remove a user’s access to an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/application-access-assignment-how-to-remove-assignment).

2. Extract the **ADMX** files and copy them to your central store.
3. Open Group Policy Management.
4. Create a Group Policy Object with the following setting: **User Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Microsoft Office 2016** > **Miscellaneous** > **Show LinkedIn features in Office applications**.
5. Select **Enabled** or **Disabled**.
  
 State | Effect
------ | ------
**Enabled** | The **Show LinkedIn features in Office applications** setting in Office 2016 Options is enabled. Users in your organization can use LinkedIn features in their Office applications.
 **Disabled** | The **Show LinkedIn features in Office applications** setting in Office 2016 Options is disabled and end users can't change this setting. Users in your organization can't use LinkedIn features in their Office 2016 applications.

This group policy affects only Office 2016 apps for a local computer. Users can see LinkedIn features in profile cards throughout Office 365 even if they disable LinkedIn in their Office 2016 apps.
