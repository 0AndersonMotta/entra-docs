# Custom administrator role available permissions in Azure Active Directory

## Available permissions

There are two types of applications, single-tenant and multi-tenant. Single-tenant applications are only available to users in the Azure AD tenant where the application is registered. Multi-tenant applications are supported by all Azure AD tenants. Single-tenant applications are defined as having **Supported account types** set to "Accounts in this organizational directory only". In the Graph API, single-tenant applications have the signInAudience property set to "AzureADMyOrg".
