1. Select the group that you are interested in.

1. Select Assigned Roles tab from left pane. You can now see all the Azure AD roles assigned to this group. 

## Using PowerShell

### Get object id of the group

Get-AzureADMSGroup -SearchString “Contoso_Helpdesk_Administrators”

### View role assignment to a group

Get-AzureADMSRoleAssignment -Filter "principalId eq '<object id of group>" 

## Using Microsoft Graph API
