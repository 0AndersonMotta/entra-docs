# Sign-in options for Microsoft accounts in Microsoft 365

The Microsoft 365 sign-in page supports one or both of work or school accounts and Microsoft accounts, depending on the situation, to support:

* Apps that accept sign-ins from both types of account
* Organizations that accept guests

You can tell if the sign-in page your organization uses supports Microsoft accounts by looking at the hint text in the username field. If the hint text says "Email, phone, or Skype", the sign-in page supports Microsoft accounts.

Additional sign-in options that only work for personal Microsoft accounts are being rolled out. The additional sign-in options can't be used for signing in to work or school account resources.
