# Download a list of users in the Azure Active Directory portal

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) supports bulk user create and delete operations, bulk invite for guests, and supports downloading lists of users, groups, and group members.

## To download a list of users

1. Sign in to your Azure AD organization with a User administrator account in the organization.
1. In Azure AD, select **Users** > **Bulk create**.
1. On the **Bulk create user** page, select **Download** to receive a valid CSV file of user properties, and then add your new users.
1. When you finish editing the CSV file or if you have different one of your own ready to upload, select the file under **Upload your CSV file** to be validated. The file contents are validated and you must fix any errors before you can submit the job.
1. When your file passes validation, select **Submit** to start the Azure batch job that adds the new user information. Job notifications are generated to apprise you of progress.
