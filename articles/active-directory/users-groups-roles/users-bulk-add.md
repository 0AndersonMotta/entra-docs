# Bulk add users in the Azure Active Directory portal

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) supports bulk user create and delete operations, and supports downloading lists of users, groups, and group members.

## To bulk add users

1. Sign in to your Azure AD organization with an account that is a User administrator in the organization.
1. In Azure AD, select **Users** > **Bulk create**.
1. On the **Bulk create user** page, select **Download** to receive and edit a valid formatted CSV file of user properties.
1. When you finish editing the CSV file or if you have one of your own ready to upload, select the file under **Upload your CSV file** to be validated. 
1. When the file contents are validated, you must fix eny errors before you can start the upload job.
1. When your file passes validation, select **Submit** to start the Azure batch job that updates the user records. Job notifications are generated to apprise you of progress to completion.
