# Bulk restore deleted users (preview) in the Azure Active Directory

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) supports bulk user create and delete operations, bulk invite for guests, and supports downloading lists of users, groups, and group members.

## To bulk restore users

1. [Sign in to your Azure AD organization](https://aad.portal.azure.com) with an account that is a User administrator in the organization.
1. In Azure AD, select **Users** > **Deleted**.
1. On the **Deleted users** page, select **Bulk restore** to upload a valid CSV file of properties of the users to restore.

   ![Select the bulk restore command on the Deleted users page](./media/users-bulk-add/bulk-restore.png)

1. When you finish editing the CSV file or if you have one of your own ready to upload, select the file under **Upload your CSV file** to be validated.

   ![Select a local CSV file in which you list the users you want to add](./media/users-bulk-add/upload-button.png)

1. When the file contents are validated, fix the file info and re-submit the file if there are errors. Submitting a valid file starts the data upload job automatically.
1. After the CSV file passes validation, select **Submit** to start the Azure batch job that restore the users.

## Check status

You can see the status of all of your pending bulk requests in the **Bulk operation results (preview)** page.

Next, you can check to see that the users you created exist in the directory either in the Azure portal or by using PowerShell.

## View restored users in the Azure portal

1. [Sign in to the Azure AD admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com) with an account that is a User administrator in the organization.
1. In the navigation pane, select **Azure Active Directory**.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Users**.
1. Under **Show**, select **All users** and verify that the users you restored are listed.

### View users with PowerShell

Run the following command:

``` PowerShell
Get-AzureADUser -Filter "UserType eq 'Member'"
```

You should see that the users that you restored are listed.
