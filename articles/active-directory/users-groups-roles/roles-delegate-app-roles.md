#As an Azure AD administrator, I want to reduce the exposure caused by Global Administrator's frequent assignment by delegating permissions for access management for apps to lower-privilege roles.

# Delegate app administrator roles in Azure Active Directory

The increasing number of apps proliferating in your organization can strain your resources if you place the burden for application access management on Global Administrators. This model only increases its overhead as time goes on. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) supports granting less-privileged administrative roles to manage application access. Some delegation issues and general guidelines are provided in [Delegate administration in Azure Active Directory](roles-concept-delegation.md).

Besides reducing Global Administrator overhead, delegating specialized privileges to manage application access tasks can improve your security posture and reduce the potential for costly mistakes.

## Delegate app administration

To grant the ability to manage application access in the Azure portal:

1. Sign in to your [Azure AD tenant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview) with an account that is the Global Administrator for the tenant.
2. Open the [Roles and administrators page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RolesAndAdministrators).
3. Open one of the following roles to see its member assignments:
  * **Application administrator**
  * **Cloud application administrator**
  
  These roles each grant permissions to manage application registrations, single sign-on settings, user and group assignments, licensing, and consent. Only the **Application administrator** role grants permissions to manage Application Proxy settings. Neither role grants the ability to manage Conditional Access settings.
4. On the **Members** page for the role, select **Add member**.
5. Select one or more members to add to the role. <!--Members can be users or groups.-->

## Delegate app registration

By default, all users can create application registrations, but you can selectively grant permission to create application registrations or permission to consent to application requests to access data.

1. Sign in to your [Azure AD tenant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview) with an account that is the Global Administrator for the tenant.
2. Set one or both of the following to No:
  * On the [User settings page for your tenant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/UserSettings), set **Users can register applications** to No.
  * On the [user settings for enterprise applications](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade/UserSettings/menuId/), set **Users can consent to applications accessing company data on their behalf** to No.
3. Then assign users needing this permission to be members of the Application Developer role in the manner described in [Delegate app administration](#delegate-app-administration).

When a member of the Application Developer role creates a new application registration, they are automatically added as the first owner.

## Delegate app ownership

Azure AD provides two levels of role permissions for users who are to own enterprise applications. The **Enterprise Application Owner** role grants the user permission to manage enterprise applications that the user owns, including single sign-on settings, user and group assignments, and adding additional owners. It doesn't grant permission to manage Application Proxy settings or Conditional Access settings. The **Application Registration Owner** role grants only permission to manage application registrations for app that the user owns, including the application manifest and adding additional owners.

As members of these roles, owners can manage only the enterprise applications they own. For example, when you add an owner for the Salesforce application, that owner can manage access to and configuration for Salesforce but not for any other applications. An enterprise application can have many owners, and a user can be the owner for many enterprise applications.

### To assign an enterprise app ownership role to a user

1. Sign in to your [Azure AD tenant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview) with an account that is the Global Administrator for the tenant.
2. On the [Roles and administrators page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RolesAndAdministrators), open one of the following roles to see its member assignments:
  * **Enterprise Application Owner**
  * **Application Registration Owner**
3. On the **Members** page for the role, select **Add member**.
4. Select one or more members to add to the role. <!--Members can be users or groups.-->

### To assign ownership to an enterprise application

1. Sign in to your [Azure AD tenant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview) with an account that is the Global Administrator for the tenant.
2. On the [Enterprise Applications page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade/AllApps/menuId/), select an enterprise app to open the Overview page for the app.
3. Select Owners to see the list of the owners for the app.
4. Select **Add** to select one or more owners to add to the app.
