# Create a group for assigning roles in Azure Active Directory

You can only assign a role to a group that was created with the ‘isAssignableToRole’ property set to True, or was created in the Azure AD portal with "Eligible for role assignment". This group attribute makes the group eligible to be assigned to a role in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This article describes how to create such a group.

## Using Azure AD admin center

1. Sign in to the [Azure AD admin center](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview) with Privileged role administrator or Global administrator permissions in the Azure AD organization.
1. Select **Groups** > **All groups** > **New group**.

   ![Open Azure Active Directory and create a new group](./media/roles-groups-create-eligible/new-group.png)

1. On the **New Group** tab, provide group type, name and description.
1. Turn on **Eligible for role assignment**. This switch is visible to only Privileged Role Administrators and Global Administrators because these are only two roles that can set the switch.

   ![Make the new group eligible for role assignment](./media/roles-groups-create-eligible/eligible-switch.png)

1. Select the members and roles for the group. You don't have to assign roles when you create the group.

   ![Add members at the role-eligible group and assign roles](./media/roles-groups-create-eligible/specify-members.png)

1. After members and roles are selected, select **Create**.

   ![The Create button is at the bottom of the page](./media/roles-groups-create-eligible/create-button.png)

The group is created with any selected roles assigned to it. You can also choose not to assign roles during creation and assign them later on.

## Using PowerShell

    install-module azureadpreview
    import-module azureadpreview

### To verify that the module is ready to use, use the following command:

    get-module azureadpreview

### Create a group that can be assigned to role

    $group = New-AzureADMSGroup -DisplayName "Contoso_Helpdesk_Administrators" -Description "This group is assigned to Helpdesk Administrator built-in role in Azure AD." -MailEnabled $true -SecurityEnabled $true -MailNickName "contosohelpdeskadministrators" -IsAssignableToRole $true

For this type of group, groupType will always be "Unified" and isPublic will always be false.

## Using Microsoft Graph API

### Create a group that can be assigned Azure AD role

    POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/groups
    {
    "description": "This group is assigned to Helpdesk Administrator built-in role of Azure AD.",
    "displayName": "Contoso_Helpdesk_Administrators",
    "groupTypes": [
    "Unified"
    ],
    "mailEnabled": true,
    "securityEnabled": true
    "mailNickname": "contosohelpdeskadministrators",
    "isAssignableToRole": true,
    }
