# Bulk dlownload the membership list for a group in Azure Active Directory

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) supports bulk group list download, bulk import for group members, and bulk removal of group members.

## To bulk download group membership

1. [Sign in to your Azure AD organization](https://aad.portal.azure.com) with a User administrator account in the organization.
1. In Azure AD, select **Groups** > **All groups**.
1. Open the group to which you're adding members and then select **Members**.
1. On the **Members** page, select **Remove members** to download, update, and upload a CSV file listing the members that you want to import into the group.

   ![The Download Members command is on the profile page for the group](./media/groups-bulk-download-members/download-panel.png)
