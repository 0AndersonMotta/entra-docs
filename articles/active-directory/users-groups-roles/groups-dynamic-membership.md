# Create groups using dynamic membership rules in Azure Active Directory

In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can create complex attribute-based rules to enable dynamic memberships for groups. This article details the attributes and syntax to create dynamic membership rules for users or devices. You can set up a rule for dynamic membership on security groups or Office 365 groups.

When any attributes of a user or device change, the system evaluates all dynamic group rules in a directory to see if the change would trigger any group adds or removes. If a user or device satisfies a rule on a group, they are added as a member of that group. If they no longer satisfy the rule, they are removed.

* You can create a dynamic group for devices or for users, but you can't create a rule that contains both users and devices.
* You can't create a device group based on the device owners' attributes. Device membership rules can only reference device attributes.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature requires an Azure AD Premium P1 license for each unique user that is a member of one or more dynamic groups. You don't have to assign licenses to users for them to be members of dynamic groups, but you must have the minimum number of licenses in the tenant to cover all such users. For example, if you had a total of 1,000 unique users in all dynamic groups in your tenant, you would need at least 1,000 licenses for Azure AD Premium P1 to meet the license requirement.

## To create a group membership rule

1. Sign in to the [Azure AD admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com) with an account that is a global administrator or a user account administrator.
2. Select **Users and groups**.
3. Select **All groups**, and select **New group**.

   ![Add new group](./media/groups-dynamic-membership/new-group-creation.png)

4. On the **Group** blade, enter a name and description for the new group. Select a **Membership type** of either **Dynamic User** or **Dynamic Device**, depending on whether you want to create a rule for users or devices, and then select **Add dynamic query**. You can use the rule builder to build a simple rule, or write an advanced rule yourself. This article contains more information about available user and device attributes as well as examples of advanced rules.

   ![Add dynamic membership rule](./media/groups-dynamic-membership/add-dynamic-group-rule.png)

5. After creating the rule, select **Add query** at the bottom of the blade.
6. Select **Create** on the **Group** blade to create the group.

> [!TIP]
> Group creation fails if the rule you entered was incorrectly formed or not valid. A notification is displayed in the upper-right hand corner of the portal, containing an explanation of why the rule could not be processed. Read it carefully to understand how you need to adjust the rule to make it valid.

## Status of the dynamic rule

You can see the membership processing status and the last updated date on the Overview page for your dynamic group.
  
  ![dynamic group status display](./media/groups-dynamic-membership/group-status.png)


The following status messages can be shown for **Membership processing** status:

* **Evaluating**:  The group change has been received and the updates are being evaluated.
* **Processing**: Updates are being processed.
* **Update complete**: Processing has completed and all applicable updates have been made.
* **Processing error**: An error was encountered while evaluating the membership rule and processing could not be completed.
* **Update paused**: Dynamic membership rule updates have been paused by the administrator. MembershipRuleProcessingState is set to “Paused”.

The following status messages can be shown for **Membership last updated** status:

* &lt;**Date and time**&gt;: The last time the membership was updated.
* **In Progress**: Updates are currently in progress.
* **Unknown**: The last update time cannot be retrieved. It may be due to the group being newly created.

If an error occurs while processing the membership rule for a specific group, an alert is shown on the top of the **Overview page** for the group. If no pending dynamic membership updates can be processed for all the groups within the tenant for more then 24 hours, an alert is shown on the top of **All groups**.

## Constructing the body of a membership rule

The **Simple** rule that you can create to automatically populate groups with users or devices is a binary expression that results in a true or false outcome. The three parts of a simple rule are:

* Property
* Operator
* Value

The order of the parts within an expression are important to avoid syntax errors.

### Rules with a single expression

A single expression is the simplest form of an advanced rule and only has the three parts mentioned above. A complete advanced rule with a single expression looks similar to this: `Property Operator Value`, where the syntax for the property is the value of object.property. 
The following is an example of a properly constructed advanced rule with a single expression:

```
user.department -eq "Sales"
```

Parentheses are optional for a single expression. The total length of the body of your membership rule cannot exceed 2048 characters.

## Supported properties

There are three types of properties that can be used to construct a membership rule.

* Boolean
* String
* String collection

The following are the user properties that you can use to create a single expression.

### Properties of type boolean

Allowed operators

* -eq
* -ne

| Properties | Allowed values | Usage |

| --- | --- | --- |
| otherMails |Any string value |(user.otherMails -contains "alias@domain") |
| proxyAddresses |SMTP: alias@domain smtp: alias@domain |(user.proxyAddresses -contains "SMTP: alias@domain") |

For the properties used for device rules, see [Rules for devices](#rules-for-devices).

## Supported operators

The following table lists all the supported operators and their syntax for a single expression. Operators can be used with or without the hyphen (-) prefix.

| Operator | Syntax |
| --- | --- |
| Not Equals |-ne |
| Equals |-eq |
| Not Starts With |-notStartsWith |
| Starts With |-startsWith |
| Not Contains |-notContains |
| Contains |-contains |
| Not Match |-notMatch |
| Match |-match |
| In | -in |
| Not In | -notIn |

### Using the -In and -notIn operators

If you want to compare the value of a user attribute against a number of different values you can use the -In or -notIn operators. Use the bracket symbols "[" and "]" to begin and end the list of values. This condition evaluates to True of the value of user.department equals one or more of the values in the list.

 In the following example, the expression evaluates to true if the value of user.department equals any of the values in the list:

```
   user.department -In ["50001","50002","50003",“50005”,“50006”,“50007”,“50008”,“50016”,“50020”,“50024”,“50038”,“50039”,“51100”]
```

## Supported values

The values used in an expression can consist of several types, including:

* Strings
* Boolean – true, false
* Numbers
* Arrays – number array, string array

When specifying a value within an expression it is important to use the correct syntax to avoid errors. Some syntax tips are:

* Double quotes are optional unless the value is a string.
* String and regex operations are not case sensitive.
* When a string value contains double quotes, both quotes should be escaped using the \` character, for example, user.department -eq \`"Sales\`" is the proper syntax when "Sales" is the value.
* You can also perform Null checks, using null as a value, for example, user.department -eq null.

### Use of Null values

To specify a null value in a rule, you can use the *null* value. 

* Use -eq or -ne when comparing the *nulll* value in an expression.
* Use quotes around the word *null* only if you want it to be interpreted as a literal string value.
* The -not operator can't be used as a comparative operator for null. If you use it, you get an error whether you use null or $null.

The correct way to reference the null value is as follows:

```
   user.mail –ne null
```

## Rules with multiple expressions

A group membership rule can consist of more than one single expression connected by the -and, -or, and -not logical operators. Logical operators can also be used in combination. The following are examples of properly constructed advanced rules with multiple expressions:

```
(user.department -eq "Sales") -or (user.department -eq "Marketing")
(user.department -eq "Sales") -and -not (user.jobTitle -contains "SDE")
```

### Operator precedence

All operators are listed below in order of precedence from highest to lowest. Operators on same line are of equal precedence:

```
-eq -ne -startsWith -notStartsWith -contains -notContains -match –notMatch -in -notIn
-not
-and
-or
-any -all
```

The following is an example of operator precedence where two expressions are being evaluated for the user:

```
   user.department –eq "Marketing" –and user.country –eq "US"
```

Parentheses are needed only when precedence does not meet your requirements. For example, if you want department to be evaluated first, the following shows how parentheses can be used to determine order:

```
   user.country –eq "US" –and (user.department –eq "Marketing" –or user.department –eq "Sales")
```

## Rules with complex expressions

An advanced rule can consist of complex expressions where the properties, operators, and values take on more complex forms. Expressions are considered complex when any of the following are true:

* The property consists of a collection of values; specifically, multi-valued properties
* The expressions use the -any and -all operators
* The value of the expression can itself be one or more expressions

## Multi-value properties

Multi-value properties are collections of objects of the same type. They can be used to create advanced rules using the -any and -all logical operators.

* -any (satisfied when at least one item in the collection matches the condition)
* -all (satisfied when all items in the collection match the condition)

| Properties | Values | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| assignedPlans | Each object in the collection exposes the following string properties: capabilityStatus, service, servicePlanId |user.assignedPlans -any (assignedPlan.servicePlanId -eq "efb87545-963c-4e0d-99df-69c6916d9eb0" -and assignedPlan.capabilityStatus -eq "Enabled") |
| proxyAddresses| SMTP: alias@domain smtp: alias@domain | (user.proxyAddresses -any (\_ -contains "contoso")) |

### Using the -any and -all operators

You can use -any and -all operators to apply a condition to one or all of the items in the collection, respectively.

* -any (satisfied when at least one item in the collection matches the condition)
* -all (satisfied when all items in the collection match the condition)

#### Example 1

assignedPlans is a multi-value property that lists all service plans assigned to the user. The following expression selects users who have the Exchange Online (Plan 2) service plan (as a GUID value) that is also in Enabled state:

```
user.assignedPlans -any (assignedPlan.servicePlanId -eq "efb87545-963c-4e0d-99df-69c6916d9eb0" -and assignedPlan.capabilityStatus -eq "Enabled")
```

A rule such as this one can be used to group all users for whom an Office 365 (or other Microsoft Online Service) capability is enabled. You could then apply with a set of policies to the group.

#### Example 2

The following expression selects all users who have any service plan that is associated with the Intune service (identified by service name "SCO"):

```
user.assignedPlans -any (assignedPlan.service -eq "SCO" -and assignedPlan.capabilityStatus -eq "Enabled")
```

### Using the underscore (\_) syntax

The underscore (\_) syntax matches occurrences of a specific value in one of the multivalued string collection properties to add users or devices to a dynamic group. It is used with the -any or -all operators.

Here's an example of using the underscore (\_) in a rule to add members based on user.proxyAddress (it works the same for user.otherMails). This rule adds any user with proxy address that contains "contoso" to the group.

```
(user.proxyAddresses -any (_ -contains "contoso"))
```

## Other properties and common rules

### "Direct Reports" rule

You can create a group containing all direct reports of a manager. When the manager's direct reports change in the future, the group's membership is adjusted automatically.

The direct reports rule is constructed using the following syntax:

```
Direct Reports for "{objectID_of_manager}"
```

The following tips can help you use the rule properly.

* The **Manager ID** is the object ID of the manager. It can be found in the manager's **Profile**.
* For the rule to work, make sure the **Manager** property is set correctly for users in your tenant. You can check the current value in the user's **Profile**.
* This rule supports only the manager's direct reports. In other words, you can't create a group with the manager's direct reports *and* their reports.
* This rule can't be combined with any other advanced rules.

### Create an "All users" rule

You can create a group containing all users within a tenant using an advanced rule. When users are added or removed from the tenant in the future, the group's membership is adjusted automatically.

The “All users” rule is constructed using single expression using the -ne operator and the null value:

```
user.objectid -ne null
```

### Create an “All devices” rule

You can create a group containing all devices within a tenant using an advanced rule. When devices are added or removed from the tenant in the future, the group's membership is adjusted automatically.

The “All Devices” rule is constructed using single expression using the -ne operator and the null value:

```
device.objectid -ne null
```

### Extension properties and custom extension properties

Extension attributes and custom extenson properties are supported as string properties in dynamic membership rules. Extension attributes are synced from on-premises Window Server AD and take the format of "ExtensionAttributeX", where X equals 1 - 15. An example of a rule that uses an extension attribute might be:

```
(user.extensionAttribute15 -eq "Marketing")
```

Custom extension properties are synced from on-premises Windows Server AD or from a connected SaaS application and the format of `user.extension_[GUID]\__[Attribute]`, where:

* [GUID] is the unique identifier in Azure AD for the application that created the attribute in Azure AD
* [Attribute] is the name of the attribute as it was created

An example of a rule that uses a custom attribute is

```
user.extension_c272a57b722d4eb29bfe327874ae79cb__OfficeNumber  
```

The custom property name can be found in the directory by querying a user's property using Graph Explorer and searching for the property name.

### Error remediation

The following table lists common errors and how to correct them

| Rule parser error | Error usage | Corrected usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Error: Attribute not supported. |(user.invalidProperty -eq "Value") |(user.department -eq "value")<br/><br/>Make sure the attribute is on the [supported properties list](#supported-properties). |
| Error: Operator is not supported on attribute. |(user.accountEnabled -contains true) |(user.accountEnabled -eq true)<br/><br/>The operator used is not supported for the property type (in this example, -contains cannot be used on type boolean). Use the correct operators for the property type. |

## Rules for devices

You can also create a rule that selects device objects for membership in a group. You can't have both users and devices as group members. The following device attributes can be used.

 Device attribute  | Values | Example
 ----- | ----- | ----------------
 accountEnabled | true false | (device.accountEnabled -eq true)
 displayName | any string value |(device.displayName -eq "Rob Iphone”)
 deviceOSType | any string value | (device.deviceOSType -eq "iPad") -or (device.deviceOSType -eq "iPhone")
 deviceOSVersion | any string value | (device.OSVersion -eq "9.1")
 deviceCategory | a valid device category name | (device.deviceCategory -eq "BYOD")
 deviceManufacturer | any string value | (device.deviceManufacturer -eq "Samsung")
 deviceModel | any string value | (device.deviceModel -eq "iPad Air")
 deviceOwnership | Personal, Company, Unknown | (device.deviceOwnership -eq "Company")
 domainName | any string value | (device.domainName -eq "contoso.com")
 enrollmentProfileName | Apple Device Enrollment Profile or Windows Autopilot profile name | (device.enrollmentProfileName -eq "DEP iPhones")
 isRooted | true false | (device.isRooted -eq true)
 managementType | MDM (for mobile devices)<br>PC (for computers managed by the Intune PC agent) | (device.managementType -eq "MDM")
 organizationalUnit | any string value matching the name of the organizational unit set by an on-premises Active Directory | (device.organizationalUnit -eq "US PCs")
 deviceId | a valid Azure AD device ID | (device.deviceId -eq "d4fe7726-5966-431c-b3b8-cddc8fdb717d")
 objectId | a valid Azure AD object ID |  (device.objectId -eq 76ad43c9-32c5-45e8-a272-7b58b58f596d")

## Changing dynamic membership to static, and vice versa
It is possible to change how membership is managed in a group. This is useful when you want to keep the same group name and ID in the system, so any existing references to the group are still valid; creating a new group would require updating those references.

We've updated the Azure AD Admin center to add support this functionality. Now, customers can convert existing groups from dynamic membership to assigned membership and vice-versa either via Azure AD Admin center or PowerShell cmdlets as shown below.

> [!WARNING]
> When changing an existing static group to a dynamic group, all existing members will be removed from the group, and then the membership rule will be processed to add new members. If the group is used to control access to apps or resources, the original members may lose access until the membership rule is fully processed.
>
> We recommend that you test the new membership rule beforehand to make sure that the new membership in the group is as expected.

### Change membership type for a group (Azure portal)

1. Sign in to the [Azure AD admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com) with an account that is a global administrator or a user account administrator in your tenant.
2. Select **Groups**.
3. From the **All groups** list, open the group that you want to change.
4. Select **Properties**.
5. On the **Properties** page for the group, select a **Membership type** of either Assigned (static), Dynamic User, or Dynamic Device, depending on your desired membership type. For dynamic membership, you can use the rule builder to select options for a simple rule or write an advanced rule yourself. 

The following steps are an example of changing a group from static to dynamic membership for a group of users. 

1. On the **Properties** page for your selected group, select a **Membership type** of **Dynamic User**, then select Yes on the dialog explaining the changes to the group membership to continue. 
  
   ![select membership type of dynamic user](./media/groups-dynamic-membership/select-group-to-convert.png)
  
2. Select **Add dynamic query**, and then provide the rule.
  
   ![enter the rule](./media/groups-dynamic-membership/enter-rule.png)
  
3. After creating the rule, select **Add query** at the bottom of the page.
4. Select **Save** on the **Properties** page for the group to save your changes. The **Membership type** of the group is immediately updated in the group list.

> [!TIP]
> Group conversion might fail if the advanced rule you entered was incorrect. A notification is displayed in the upper-right hand corner of the portal that it contains an explanation of why the rule can't be accepted by the system. Read it carefully to understand how you can adjust the rule to make it valid.

#### Change membership type for a group (PowerShell)

> [!NOTE]
> To change dynamic group properties you will need to use cmdlets from **the preview version of** [Azure AD PowerShell Version 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2?view=azureadps-2.0). You can install the preview from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzureADPreview).

Here is an example of functions that switch membership management on an existing group. In this example, care is taken to correctly manipulate the GroupTypes property and preserve any values that are unrelated to dynamic membership.

```
#The moniker for dynamic groups as used in the GroupTypes property of a group object
$dynamicGroupTypeString = "DynamicMembership"

function ConvertDynamicGroupToStatic
{
    Param([string]$groupId)

    #existing group types
    [System.Collections.ArrayList]$groupTypes = (Get-AzureAdMsGroup -Id $groupId).GroupTypes

    if($groupTypes -eq $null -or !$groupTypes.Contains($dynamicGroupTypeString))
    {
        throw "This group is already a static group. Aborting conversion.";
    }


    #remove the type for dynamic groups, but keep the other type values
    $groupTypes.Remove($dynamicGroupTypeString)

    #modify the group properties to make it a static group: i) change GroupTypes to remove the dynamic type, ii) pause execution of the current rule
    Set-AzureAdMsGroup -Id $groupId -GroupTypes $groupTypes.ToArray() -MembershipRuleProcessingState "Paused"
}

function ConvertStaticGroupToDynamic
{
    Param([string]$groupId, [string]$dynamicMembershipRule)

    #existing group types
    [System.Collections.ArrayList]$groupTypes = (Get-AzureAdMsGroup -Id $groupId).GroupTypes

    if($groupTypes -ne $null -and $groupTypes.Contains($dynamicGroupTypeString))
    {
        throw "This group is already a dynamic group. Aborting conversion.";
    }
    #add the dynamic group type to existing types
    $groupTypes.Add($dynamicGroupTypeString)

    #modify the group properties to make it a static group: i) change GroupTypes to add the dynamic type, ii) start execution of the rule, iii) set the rule
    Set-AzureAdMsGroup -Id $groupId -GroupTypes $groupTypes.ToArray() -MembershipRuleProcessingState "On" -MembershipRule $dynamicMembershipRule
}
```
To make a group static:

```
ConvertDynamicGroupToStatic "a58913b2-eee4-44f9-beb2-e381c375058f"
```

To make a group dynamic:

```
ConvertStaticGroupToDynamic "a58913b2-eee4-44f9-beb2-e381c375058f" "user.displayName -startsWith ""Peter"""
```
