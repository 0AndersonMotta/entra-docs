# Azure Active Directory Pass-through Authentication: GDPR compliance

## Overview

In May 2018, a European privacy law, the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/index_en.htm), is due to take effect. The GDPR imposes new rules on companies, government agencies, non-profits, and other organizations that offer goods and services to people in the European Union (EU), or that collect and analyze data tied to EU residents. The GDPR applies no matter where you are located. 

Microsoft products and services are available today to help you meet the GDPR requirements. Read more about Microsoft Privacy policy at [Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter)

Azure AD Pass-through Authentication creates the following log types, which can contain EUII:

- Azure AD Connect trace log files.
- Authentication Agent trace log files.
- Windows Event log files.

General Data Protection Regulation compliance for Pass-through Authentication can be reached in two ways:

1.	Upon request, extract data for a person and remove data from that person from the installations.
2.	Ensure no data is retained beyond 48 hours.

We strongly recommend the second option as it is easier to implement and maintain. See below for instructions for each log type:
