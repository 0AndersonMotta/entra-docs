# Azure Active Directory Pass-through Authentication: GDPR compliance

## Overview

In May 2018, a European privacy law, the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/index_en.htm), is due to take effect. The GDPR imposes new rules on companies, government agencies, non-profits, and other organizations that offer goods and services to people in the European Union (EU), or that collect and analyze data tied to EU residents. The GDPR applies no matter where you are located. 

Microsoft products and services are available today to help you meet the GDPR requirements. Read more about Microsoft Privacy policy at [Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter)

Azure AD Pass-through Authentication creates the following log types, which can contain EUII:

- Azure AD Connect trace log files.
- Authentication Agent trace log files.
- Windows Event log files.

GDPR compliance for Pass-through Authentication can be reached in two ways:

1.	Upon request, extract data for a person and remove data from that person from the installations.
2.	Ensure no data is retained beyond 48 hours.

We strongly recommend the second option as it is easier to implement and maintain. See below for instructions for each log type:

### Delete Azure AD Connect trace log files

You should check the contents of **%ProgramData%\AADConnect** folder and delete the trace log contents (**trace-\*.log** files) of this folder within 48 hours of installing or upgrading Azure AD Connect or modifying Pass-through Authentication configuration, as this action may create data covered by GDPR.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Donâ€™t delete the **PersistedState.xml** file in this folder, as this file is used to maintain the state of the previous installation of Azure AD Connect and is used when an upgrade installation is done. This file will never contain any data about a person and should never be deleted.

You can either review and delete these trace log files using Windows Explorer or you can use a PowerShell script like the one below to perform the necessary actions:

```
$Files = ((Get-Item -Path "$env:programdata\aadconnect\trace-*.log").VersionInfo).FileName 
 
Foreach ($file in $Files) { 
    {Remove-Item -Path $File -Force} 
}
```

Save the script in a file with the .PS1 extension. Run this script as needed.
