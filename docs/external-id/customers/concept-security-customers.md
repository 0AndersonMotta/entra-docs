# Identity governance for CIAM

CIAM Governance allows you to balance your organization's need for security and employee productivity with the right processes and visibility. It provides you with capabilities to ensure that the right people have the right access to the right resources. These and related Azure AD and Enterprise Mobility + Security features allows you to mitigate access risk by protecting, monitoring, and auditing access to critical assets while ensuring employee and business partner productivity.  

## Identity lifecycle

Identity Governance helps organizations achieve a balance between *productivity* - How quickly can a person have access to the resources they need, such as when they join my organization? And *security* - How should their access change over time, such as due to changes to that person's employment status? 

## Access lifecycle

Organizations need a process to manage access beyond what was initially provisioned for a user when that user's identity was created.  Furthermore, enterprise organizations need to be able to scale efficiently to be able to develop and enforce access policy and controls on an ongoing basis.

## Getting started

Check out the Getting started tab of **Identity Governance** in the Azure portal to start using entitlement management, access reviews, Privileged Identity Management, and Terms of use, and see some common use cases.
