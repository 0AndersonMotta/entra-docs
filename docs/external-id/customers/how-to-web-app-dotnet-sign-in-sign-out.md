# Sign in and sign out from an ASP.NET Core application with CIAM

In the [previous article](./how-to-web-app-dotnet-sign-in-prepare-app.md), an ASP.NET Core project was created and configured for authentication. This how-to guide will install the required packages, add code that implements authentication to the sign in and sign out experience. Finally, you'll sign-in and sign-out of the application.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of the prerequisites and steps in [Tutorial: Prepare an application for authentication](./how-to-web-app-dotnet-sign-in-prepare-app.md).

## Install identity packages

Identity related NuGet packages must be installed in the project for authentication of users to be enabled.

1. In the terminal, navigate to *aspnet_ciam_webapp*.
1. Enter the following commands to install the relevant NuGet packages:

    ```powershell
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Identity.Web.MicrosoftGraph
    ```

## Add source code to Program and Controller

1. Navigate to *Controllers* and open *HomeController.cs*. 
1. Authorization needs to be added to the controller, add `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization` so that the top of the file is identical to the following snippet:

    ```cshtml
    using System.Diagnostics;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using aspnet_ciam_webapp.Models;
    ```

1. Additionally, add the following attribute directly above the `HomeController` class definition:

    ```csharp
    [Authorize]
    ```

1. Open *Program.cs* and add the following snippet to the top of the file:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Authorization;
    using Microsoft.Identity.Web;
    using Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI;
    ```

1. Next we need to add the services to the container and sign users in with the Microsoft identity platform. After `Services.AddControllersWithViews();` add the following snippet:

    ```csharp
    // Sign-in users with the Microsoft identity platform
    builder.Services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(builder.Configuration);

    builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews(options =>
    {
        var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
            .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
            .Build();
        options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
    }).AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();
    ```


## Add the sign-in and sign-out experience

After installing the NuGet packages and adding necessary code for authentication, we need to add the sign-in and sign-out experiences.

1. In your IDE, navigate to *Views* > *Shared*, and create a new file called *_LoginPartial.cshtml*. 
1. Open *_LoginPartial.cshtml* and add the following code for adding the sign in and sign out experience:

    ```csharp
    @using System.Security.Principal

    <ul class="navbar-nav">
    @if (User.Identity is not null && User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
    {
            <li class="nav-item">
                <span class="nav-link text-dark">Hello @User.Identity.Name!</span>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="MicrosoftIdentity" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="SignOut">Sign out</a>
            </li>
    }
    else
    {
            <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="MicrosoftIdentity" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="SignIn">Sign in</a>
            </li>
    }
    </ul>
    ```

1. Next, add a reference to `_LoginPartial` in the *Layout.cshtml* file, which is located in the same folder. It's recommended to place this after the `navbar-collapse` class as shown in the following snippet:

	```html
    <div class="navbar-collapse collapse d-sm-inline-flex flex-sm-row-reverse">
        <partial name="_LoginPartial" />
    ```

## Sign-in to the application

1. Start the application by typing the following in the terminal:

    ### [.NET 6.0](#tab/dotnet6)

    ```powershell
    dotnet run
    ```

    ### [.NET 7.0](#tab/dotnet7)

    ```powershell
    dotnet run --launch-profile https
    ```

1. Open a new private browser, and enter the application URI into the browser, for example `https://localhost:{port}`.
1. Select **No account? Create one**, which starts the sign-up flow.
1. In the **Create account** window, enter the email address registered to your CIAM tenant which will start the sign-up flow as a user for your application.
1. After entering a one-time passcode from the CIAM tenant, enter a new password and more account details, this sign-up flow is completed.
    1. If a window appears prompting you to **Stay signed in**, choose either **Yes** or **No**.
1. The ASP.NET Welcome page appears in your browser as depicted in the following screenshot:

## Sign out of the application

1. To sign out of the application, select **Sign out** in the navigation bar.
1. A window appears asking which account to sign out of.
1. Upon successful sign out, a final window similar to the following will appear, advising you to close all browser windows.
