# Define custom attributes for user flows in CIAM

For each application, you might have different requirements for the information you want to collect during sign-up from your customers. Azure AD comes with a built-in set of information stored in attributes, such as Given Name, Surname, City, and Postal Code. With CIAM, you can extend the set of attributes stored on a guest account when the cusrokomer signs up through a user flow.

You can create custom attributes in the Azure portal and use them in your self-service sign-up user flows. You can also read and write these attributes by using the Microsoft Graph API. Microsoft Graph API supports creating and updating a user with extension attributes. Extension attributes in the Graph API are named by using the convention `extension_<extensions-app-id>_attributename`. For example:

```JSON
"extension_831374b3bd5041bfaa54263ec9e050fc_loyaltyNumber": "212342"
```

The `<extensions-app-id>` is specific to your tenant. To find this identifier, navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations** > **All applications**. Search for the app that starts with "aad-extensions-app" and select it. On the app's Overview page, note the Application (client) ID.

Once you've created a new user using a user flow that uses the newly created custom attribute, the object can be queried in [Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer). You should now see new name in the list of attributes collected during the sign-up journey on the user object. You can call the Graph API from your application to get the data from this attribute after it's added to the user object.
