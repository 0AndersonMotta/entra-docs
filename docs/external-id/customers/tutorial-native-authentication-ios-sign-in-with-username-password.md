# Tutorial: Sign in using username and password

This tutorial demonstrates how to sign in using username and password.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

- Sign in using username and password.
- Handle errors

## Sign in using username and password

To sign in a user using username (email address) and password, will use the `signIn(username:password:delegate)` method, which will respond asynchronously by calling one of the methods on the passed delegate object, which must implement the `SignInStartDelegate` protocol.

1. In the `signIn(username:password:delegate)` method, we pass in the email address that the user supplied us with, their password, and pass `self` for the delegate:

   ```swift
   nativeAuth.signIn(username: email, password: password, delegate: self)
   ```

1. To implement `SignInStartDelegate` protocol as an extension to our class, use the following code snippet:

   ```swift
   extension ViewController: SignInStartDelegate {
       func onSignInStartError(error: MSAL.SignInStartError) {
           resultTextView.text = "Error signing in: \(error.errorDescription ?? "no description")"
       }

       func onSignInCompleted(result: MSAL.MSALNativeAuthUserAccountResult) {
           // User successfully signed in
       }
   }
   ```

## Handle errors

In our earlier implementation of `SignInStartDelegate` protocol, we displayed the error when we handled the `onSignInError(error)` delegate function.

We can enhance the user experience by handling the specific error type as follows:

```swift
func onSignInStartError(error: MSAL.SignInStartError) {
    if error.isInvalidUsername || error.isInvalidCredentials {
        resultTextView.text = "Invalid username or password"
    } else {
        resultTextView.text = "Error signing in: \(error.errorDescription ?? "no description")"
    }
}
```
