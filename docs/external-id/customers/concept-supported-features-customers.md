- Enable password reset	
- Configure default branding or Company branding
- Configure Google as an identity provider	
- Configure Facebook as an identity provider	
- Customize sign-in strings	
- Configure OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant flow	
- Receive external claims in tokens by using a custom extension
- API for CIAM tenant creation		
- API for custom branding	
- API for CIAM user flows
