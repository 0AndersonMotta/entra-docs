#Customer intent: As a dev, devops, or it admin, I want to see the end user's experience when they sign in to an application that uses the user flow I created.

# Test your sign-up and sign-in user flow  

The **Run user flow** feature allows you to test your user flows by simulating a userâ€™s sign-up or sign-in experience with your application. You can use this feature to verify that your user flow is working as expected. To use this feature, you select the user flow associated with your application, run the user flow, and enter the requested sign-up or sign-in information.

This feature obtains most of the values it needs to run from the application registration. You can select the application you want to test and specify the browser language for the user interface, but you can generally leave the other fields at their default values.

## Prerequisites

- A **Microsoft Entra customer tenant**: You can set up a <a href="https://aka.ms/ciam-free-trial?wt.mc_id=ciamcustomertenantfreetrial_linkclick_content_cnl" target="_blank">free trial</a>, or you can create a new customer tenant in Microsoft Entra ID.
- A [sign-up and sign-in user flow](how-to-user-flow-sign-up-sign-in-customers.md).
- Your application, which is [registered with Microsoft Entra](how-to-register-ciam-app.md) and [associated with your user flow](how-to-user-flow-add-application.md).

## To test your user flow

Follow these steps to use the **Run user flow** feature to test your user flow.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).

1. Browse to **Identity** > **External Identities** > **User flows**.

1. From the list, select your user flow.

1. Select the **Run user flow** button.

1. In the **Run user flow** pane, most of the fields are populated with values from the application registration, so you can leave the default values. Refer to the following table for details.

   |Field    |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   |**Open Id Configuration URL**     | This value is retrieved from the application registration. It's the publicly accessible URL that was assigned to your application when you registered it with Microsoft Entra ID. This URL points to the OpenID configuration document used by client applications to find authentication URLs and public signing keys. The format is: `https://{tenant}.ciamlogin.com/{tenant}.onmicrosoft.com/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration?appid=00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444`        |
   |**Application**     | This menu lists the applications that are associated with this user flow. Select the application you want to test.        |
   |**Reply URL**     | This value is retrieved from the application registration. Keep the current setting, which is the redirect URI that is configured for your application.        |
   |**Response type**     | This value is retrieved from the application registration. It's the type of information the client application expects to receive from the authorization server and it determines the grant type that the client uses to obtain a token. The value is *code* for the authorization code flow, or *id_token* or *token* for the hybrid flow.        |
   |**Access Tokens**     | If the application requires an access token to securely access a protected web API, these fields contain values from the application registration. The **Resource** is the issuer of the access token. **Scopes** defines the types of protected resources that the client application can access on behalf of the user or itself.        |
   |**PKCE configuration**     | The authorization code flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is recommended for single-page applications (SPAs). With PKCE, an authorization code is delivered instead of a token to the specified reply URL of the application. You can use the autogenerated **Code Verifier** and **Code Challenge** values to test the user flow experience, or you can use the values expected by your application during development so the application can redeem the authorization code for a token.

   |**Localization**     | To test a specific language, select the **Specify ui locales** option and use **Select target language** menu to choose the language.        |
   |**Run user flow endpoint**     | This URL runs the user flow with the selected options. You can use this URL or select the **Run user flow** button.        |

1. Select **Run user flow**

1. In the sign-in page, select **Sign up now**.

1. Enter a valid email address and select **Send verification code**. Then enter the verification code that you receive and select **Verify code**.

1. Enter a new password and confirm the password.

1. You can now run the user flow again and you should be able to sign in with the account that you created.
