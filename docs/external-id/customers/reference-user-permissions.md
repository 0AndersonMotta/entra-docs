# Default user permissions in customer tenants

A customer tenant provides clear separation between your corporate workforce directory and your customer-facing app directory. Furthermore, users created in your customer tenant are restricted from accessing information about other users in the customer tenant. By default, customers canâ€™t access information about other users, groups, or devices.

The following table describes the default permissions assigned to a customer.

| **Area** | **Customer user permissions** |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Users and contacts | - Read and update their own profile through the app profile management experience  <br>- Change their own password <br>- Sign in with a local or social account |
| Applications | - Access customer-facing applications <br>- Revoke consent to applications |

## Microsoft Graph APIs and permissions

The following table indicates the API operations that enable customers to manage their profile information. The user ID or userPrincipalName is always the signed-in user's.

| User operation  | API operation                                           | Permissions required       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Read profile    | [GET /me](/graph/api/user-get) or [GET /users/{id or userPrincipalName}](/graph/api/user-get)     | User.Read                  |
| Update profile  | [PATCH /me](/graph/api/user-update) or [PATCH /users/{id or userPrincipalName}](/graph/api/user-update) <br/><br/> The following properties are updatable: city, country, displayName, givenName, jobTitle, postalCode, state, streetAddress, surname, and preferredLanguage | User.ReadWrite             |
| Change password | [POST /me/changePassword](/graph/api/user-changepassword)   | Directory.AccessAsUser.All |
