# Default user permissions in external tenants

An external tenant provides clear separation between your corporate workforce directory and your customer-facing app directory. Furthermore, users created in your external tenant are restricted from accessing information about other users in the external tenant. By default, customers canâ€™t access information about other users, groups, or devices.

The following table describes the default permissions assigned to a customer.

| **Area** | **Customer user permissions** |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Users and contacts | - Read and update their own profile through the app profile management experience  <br>- Change their own password <br>- Sign in with a local or social account |
| Applications | - Access customer-facing applications <br>- Revoke consent to applications |
