# Default user permissions in customer tenants

A customer tenant provides clear separation between your corporate workforce directory and your customer-facing app directory. Furthermore, users created in your customer tenant are restricted from accessing information about other users in the customer tenant. By default, customers canâ€™t access information about other users, groups, or devices.

The following table describes the default permissions assigned to a customer.

| **Area** | **Customer user permissions** |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Users and contacts | - Read and update their own profile through the app profile management experience  <br>- Change their own password <br>- Sign in with a local or social account |
| Applications | - Access customer-facing applications <br>- Revoke consent to applications |

## Microsoft Graph APIs and permissions

The following table indicates the API operations that enable customers to manage their own profile. The user ID or userPrincipalName are always the signed-in user's.

| User operation | API operation | Permissions required |
|--|--|--|
| Read profile | `GET /me` or `GET /users/{id or userPrincipalName}` | User.Read |
| Update profile | `PATCH /me` or `PATCH /users/{id or userPrincipalName}` | User.ReadWrite |
| Change password | `POST /users/{id or userPrincipalName}/authentication/methods/{id}/resetPassword`  where the authentication method ID is always `28c10230-6103-485e-b985-444c60001490`. | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite |
