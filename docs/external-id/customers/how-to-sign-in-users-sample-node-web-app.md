# Sign in users in a sample Node.js web application by using Microsoft Entra

This how-to guide uses a sample Node.js web application to show how to add authentication to a web application by using Microsoft Entra. The sample application enables users to sign in and sign out. The sample web application uses [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-node) for Node to handle authentication.

In this article, youâ€™ll do the following tasks:

- Register a web application in the Microsoft Entra admin center. 

- Create a sign in and sign out user flow in Microsoft Entra admin center.

- Associate your web application with the user flow. 

- Update a sample Node.js web application using your own Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for customers tenant.

- Run and test the sample web application.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or another code editor.

- Azure AD for customers tenant. If you don't already have one, [sign up for a free trial](http://developer.microsoft.com/identity/customers)


## Register the web app
