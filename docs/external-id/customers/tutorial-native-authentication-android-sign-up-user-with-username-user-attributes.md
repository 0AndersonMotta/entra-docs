# Tutorial: Sign up user with username and user attributes  
 
This tutorial aims to demonstrate how to sign up a user with a username and user attributes (**City and Country/Region**), and use one-time passcode for validation of the user's email address.  
 
In this tutorial, you learn how to:  
 
- Sign up using username and attributes.  
- Handle errors.  
 
## Prerequisites  
 
- An Android project. 
- - [How to run the Android sample app](how-to-run-sample-android-app.md). Ensure that when creating the user flow, you select **Email one-time passcode** in the **Identity providers** section, and choose **Country/Region** and **City** under **User attributes** section.
- [Tutorial: Add sign in and sign out with email one-time passcode](tutorial-native-authentication-android-sign-in-sign-out.md). 
 
## Sign up user using username and user attributes  
 
To sign up user using username (email address) and user attributes, we need to verify the email through email one-time passcode.  
 
The MSAL Android SDK provides a utility class `UserAttribute.Builder` to create user attributes.  
 
To include a user attribute, use the `UserAttribute.Builder` utility class as shown in the following code snippet:  
 
```kotlin 
    val userAttributes = UserAttributes.Builder
        .country(country)
        .city(city)
        .build() 
        
    CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main).launch {
        val actionResult = authClient.signUp(
            username = emailAddress,
            attributes = userAttributes
        )
    }  
``` 
 
In the most common scenario `signUp()` returns `SignUpResult.CodeRequired`, which will provide access to `submitCode()` and `resendCode()`. To complete the flow, you can use `submitCode()` to submit the one-time passcode using the following code snippet:  
 
```kotlin 
    CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main).launch {
        val actionResult = authClient.signUp(
            username = emailAddress,
            attributes = userAttributes
        )
        if (actionResult is SignUpResult.CodeRequired) {
            val nextState = actionResult.nextState
            val submitCodeActionResult = nextState.submitCode(
                code = code
            )
            if (submitCodeActionResult is SignUpResult.Complete) {
                // Handle sign up success
            }
        }
    } 
``` 
 
## Handle errors  

The `signUp()` action return results denoted by a dedicated results class `SignUpResult`. These can be of type: 
- `SignUpResult.Complete`
- `SignUpResult.CodeRequired`
- `SignUpResult.AttributesRequired`
- `SignUpError`

In the case of `SignUpError`, the SDK provides utility methods  for further analyzing the specific type of error returned: 
- `isUserAlreadyExists()`
- `isInvalidAttributes()`
- `isInvalidUsername()`
- `isBrowserRequired()`
- `isAuthNotSupported()`

Errors such as these indicate that the previous operation was unsuccessful, and because of that they don't include a reference to a new state. 
 
The utility method `isInvalidAttributes()` returns true when one or more attributes that were sent failed input validation. It contains an `invalidAttributes` parameter,  which is a list of all attributes that were sent by the developer that failed input validation. 
 
The result `SignUpResult.AttributesRequired` indicates that the server requires one or more attributes to be sent, before the user account can be created. This happens when  one or more attributes is set as mandatory in the tenant configuration. This result contains a `requiredAttributes` parameter, which is a list of `RequiredUserAttribute` objects, which outline details about the user attributes that the API requires. 
 
To handle `isInvalidAttributes()` and `AttributesRequired`, use the following code snippet:  
 
```kotlin 
    val actionResult = authClient.signUp(
        username = email,
        attributes = attributes
    )
    if (actionResult is SignUpError && actionResult.isInvalidAttributes()) {
        val invalidAttributes = actionResult.invalidAttributes
        // Handle "invalid attributes" error
        authClient.signUp(
            username = emailAddress,
            attributes = resubmittedAttributes
        )
    } else if (actionResult is SignUpResult.AttributesRequired) {
        val requiredAttributes = actionResult.requiredAttributes 
        // Handle "attributes required" result 
        val nextState = actionResult.nextState
        nextState.submitAttributes(
            attributes = moreAttributes
        )
    }
```
