# Sign in users in a sample Vanilla JS SPA by using Microsoft Entra

This how-to guide uses a sample Vanilla JS Single Page Application (SPA) to demonstrate how to configure an application to sign in and sign out users by using Microsoft Entra. The sample web application uses the [Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript (MSAL.js)](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js) to handle authentication.

In this article:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Register a web application in the Microsoft Entra admin center.
> * Create a sign in and sign out user flow in Microsoft Entra admin center.
> * Associate your web application with the user flow.
> * Update a vanilla JavaScript SPA web application using your own Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for customers tenant details.
> * Run and test the sample web application.

## Prerequisites

* Although any IDE that supports Vanilla JS applications can be used, **Visual Studio Code** is used for this guide. It can be downloaded from the [Downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads) page.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* Azure AD for customers tenant. If you don't already have one, [sign up for a free trial](https://aka.ms/ciam-hub-free-trial).

## Register the SPA in the Microsoft Entra admin center

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-register-app](./customers/includes/register-app/register-client-app-common.md)]
[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-app-integration-add-user-flow](./customers/includes/register-app/add-platform-redirect-url-vanilla-js.md)]

## Add app client secret

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-add-client-secret](./customers/includes/register-app/add-app-client-secret.md)]

## Grant API permissions

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-grant-delegated-permissions](./customers/includes/register-app/grant-api-permission-sign-in.md)]

## Create a user flow

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-app-integration-add-user-flow](./customers/includes/configure-user-flow/create-sign-in-sign-out-user-flow.md)]

## Associate the SPA with the user flow

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-app-integration-add-user-flow](./customers/includes/configure-user-flow/add-app-user-flow.md)]

## Clone or download sample SPA

To get the sample SPA, you can choose one of the following options:

* Clone the repository using Git:

    ```powershell
        git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-ciam-javascript-tutorial.git
    ```

* [Download the sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-ciam-javascript-tutorial/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

If you choose to download the `.zip` file, extract the sample app file to a folder where the total length of the path is 260 or fewer characters.

## Install project dependencies

1. Open a terminal window in the root directory of the sample project, and enter the following snippet to navigate to the project folder:

    ```powershell
        cd 1-Authentication\0-sign-in-vanillajs\App
    ```

1. Install the project dependencies:

    ```powershell
        npm install
    ```

## Configure the sample SPA

1. Open the `config.js`.
1. Replace the following values with the values from the Admin center.
    * `clientId` - The identifier of the application, also referred to as the client. Replace `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` with the **Application (client) ID** value that was recorded earlier from the overview page of the registered application.
    * `authority` - This is composed of two parts:
        * The *Instance* is endpoint of the cloud provider. Check with the different available endpoints in [National clouds](../develop\authentication-national-cloud.md#azure-ad-authentication-endpoints).
        * The *Tenant ID* is the identifier of the tenant where the application is registered. Replace the `_Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here` with the **Directory (tenant) ID** value that was recorded earlier from the overview page of the registered application.
1. Save the file.

## Run and test sample web app

1. Open a terminal window in the root directory of the sample project:

    ```powershell
        cd 1-Authentication\0-sign-in-vanillajs\App
    ```

1. Run the sample web app:

    ```powershell
        npm start
    ```

## Run your project and sign in

All the required code snippets have been added, so the application can now be called and tested in a web browser.

1. Open a new terminal by selecting **Terminal** > **New Terminal**.
1. Run the following command to start your express web server.

    ```powershell
    npm start
    ```

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the port specified in [Prepare a Single-page application for authentication](how-to-single-page-app-vanillajs-prepare-app.md). For example, `http://localhost:3000/ `.

<!-- SCREENSHOT -->

1. When signing in, for the purposes of this how-to guide, choose the **Sign in using Popup** option..

<!-- SCREENSHOT -->

1. After the popup window appears with the sign-in options, select the account with which to sign-in.

<!-- SCREENSHOT -->

1. A second window may appear indicating that a code will be sent to your email address. If this happens, select Send code. Open the email from the sender Microsoft account team, and enter the 7-digit single-use code. Once entered, select Sign in.

<!-- SCREENSHOT -->

1. To stay signed in, you can select either Yes or No.

<!-- SCREENSHOT -->

1. The app will now ask for permission to sign-in and access data. Select Accept to continue.

<!-- SCREENSHOT -->

1. The SPA will now display a button saying Request Profile Information. Select it to display the Microsoft Graph profile data acquired from the Microsoft Graph API.
