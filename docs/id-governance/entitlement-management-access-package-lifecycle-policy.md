# Change expiration settings for an access package in Azure AD entitlement management (Preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]

> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.

As an access package manager, you can change the expiration settings for an access package at any time by editing an existing policy. If you change the expiration date for a policy, the expiration date for requests that are already in a pending approval or approved state will not change.

This article describes how to change the expiration settings for an existing access package.
