## Prerequisites

- User that needs access to an access package

## Open the My Access portal

The first step is to open the My Access portal where you can request access to an access package. There are two ways to open the My Access portal.

1. Look for an email or a message from the project or business manager you are working with. The email should include a link to the access package you will need access to. Here is an example email with an access package link.

1. Click the **Request access package** link to open the access package in the My Access portal.

If you did not receive an email or message, you can find the access packages you can request by following these steps.

1. Sign in to the My Access portal at [https://myaccess.microsoft.com](https://myaccess.microsoft.com).

1. On the left, click **Access packages** to see the list of access packages you can request.

## Request an access package

Once you have opened the My Access portal, you can request an access package.

1. Find the access package you want to request. If necessary, in the **Details** column, click the chevron to view details about the access package.

1. Click the checkmark to select the package.

1. Click **Request access** to open the Request access pane.

1. If the **Business justification** box is displayed, type a justification for needing access.

1. If **Request for specific period?** is enabled, specify the **Yes** or **No**.

1. If necessary, specify the start date and end date.

1. When finished, click **Submit* to submit your request.

    If the access package requires approval, the request is now in a pending approval state.

## View your access and requests

The My Access portal shows what you have access to and that status of your requests.

1. In the My Access portal, on the left, click **Access packages** to see the list of access packages you have access to.

1. On the left, click **Request history** to see a list of your requests and the status.

## Cancel a request

If you submit an access request and the request is still in the **pending approval** state, you can cancel the request.

1. In the My Access portal, on the left, click **Access packages** to see a list of your requests and the status.

1. Click to open the request you want to cancel.

1. If the request is still in the **pending approval** state, you can click **Cancel** to cancel the request.

1. Click **Request history** to confirm the request was canceled.

## Select a policy

If you are requesting access to an access package that has multiple policies that apply, you might be asked to select a policy. For example, an access package manager might configure an access package with two policies for two groups of internal employees. The first policy might allow access for 60 days and require approval. The second policy might allow access for 2 days and not require approval. If you encounter this scenario, you must select the policy you want to use.
