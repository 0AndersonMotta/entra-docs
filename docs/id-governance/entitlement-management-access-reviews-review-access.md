Azure AD Entitlement Management simplifies how enterprises manage access to groups, applications, and sharepoint sites. 
This article describes how a designated reviewer performs an access review for users assigned to an access package.

Open the access review
The first step to perform an access review is to find and open the access review
1. Look for an email from Microsoft that asks you to review access. Here is an example email to review access. 

1. Click the Review access link to open the access review

1. If you don’t have the email, you can find your pending access reviews by navigating directly to https://myaccess.microsoft.com 

1. Click on Access reviews on the left navigation bar to see a list of pending access reviews assigned to you

5.	Click on the review that you’d like to begin
Perform the access review
Once you have opened the access review, you can see your access.
1.	Review your access and decide whether you still need access.

If the request is to review access for others, the page will look different. For more information, see Review access to access packages.
