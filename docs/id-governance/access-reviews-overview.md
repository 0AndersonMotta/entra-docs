# What are Azure AD Access Reviews?

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Access Reviews enable organizations to efficiently manage group memberships and access to enterprise applications. User's access can be reviewed on a regular basis to make sure only the right people have continued access.

Here's a video that provides a quick overview of access reviews:

## Why are access reviews important?

Azure AD enables you to collaborate internally within your organization and with users from external organizations, such as partners. Users can join groups, invite guests, connect to cloud apps, and work remotely from their work or personal devices. The convenience of leveraging the power of self-service has led to a need for better access management capabilities.

- As new employees join, how do you ensure they have the right access to be productive?
- As people move teams or leave the company, how do you ensure their old access is removed, especially when it involves guests?
- Excessive access rights can lead to audit findings and compromises as they indicate a lack of control over access.
- You have to proactively engage with resource owners to ensure they regularly review who has access to their resources.

## What can I do with access reviews?

- **Set up recurring reviews**: You can set up recurring access reviews of all users, employees, or guests in groups and applications. Assigned reviewers will be notified. Reviewers can approve or deny access with a friendly interface and with the help of smart recommendations.
- **Review access to groups**: If you have enabled Office groups in your organization to leverage the power of self-service, anyone in the organization can create groups and invite guests into groups. It's convenient that guests can easily gain access to groups, but you also want to make sure that there's oversight for this process. Access reviews can be created on Office and security groups and assign the group owners to confirm who should have continued access, and if the guests are still needed.
- **Review users assigned to applications**: Users assigned to Azure AD-connected applications can also be reviewed, and reviewers will receive recommendations based on the users' sign-in information to make an informative decision.

## What is the difference between Azure AD Access Reviews and Azure AD PIM?

Both Azure AD Access Reviews and Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) allow you to perform access reviews. Azure AD Access Reviews help you to review access to groups and enterprise applications. Access reviews in Azure AD PIM help you to review access to Azure AD directory roles, such as Global Administrator, and Azure resource roles.

## Where do you create reviews?

Depending on what you want to review, you will create your access review in Azure AD Access Reviews, Azure AD enterprise apps (in preview), or Azure AD PIM.

| Access rights of users | Reviewers can be | Review created in | Reviewer experience |
