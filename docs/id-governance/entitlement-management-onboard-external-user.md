# Tutorial: Onboard external users through an approval process

You can use entitlement management as a way of onboarding external users. This feature allows external users to request access to a set of resources and where you can set up approvals before they gain access to your directory. For external users onboarded through entitlement, you can manage their lifecycle through access packages. When their last access package expires, they'll be removed from your directory.

In this tutorial, you work for WoodGrove Bank as an IT administrator. You’ve been asked to create an access package to onboard partners from an outside organization that your business group is working with.
Approval is needed by an by internal sponsor from the Woodgrove Bank. Also, you've been informed that the partner's access needs to expire after 60 days.
To use Azure AD entitlement management, you must have one of the following licenses:

- Azure AD Premium P2
- Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) E5 license

For more information, see [License requirements](entitlement-management-overview.md#license-requirements).

## Step 1: Configure Basics for your Access Package

**Prerequisite role:** Global administrator, Identity Governance administrator, User administrator, Catalog owner, or Access package manager

1. In the Azure portal, in the left navigation, click **Azure Active Directory**.

2. In the left menu, click **Identity Governance**.

3. In the left menu, click **Access packages**. If you see Access denied, ensure that an Azure AD Premium P2 license is present in your directory.

4. Click **New access package**.

5. On the **Basics** tab, enter the name and description for your access package.

6. You can leave the **Catalog** drop-down list set to **General**.

## Step 2: Configure the Resources for your Access Package

1. Click **Next** to open the **Resource roles** tab.
 
 On this tab, you select the resources and the resource role to include in the access package.

2. Select the resources and roles you want for your external users from this access package.

## Step 3: Configure Requests for your Access Package

1. Click **Next** to open the **Requests** tab.

 On this tab, you create a request policy. A *policy* defines the rules or guardrails to access an access package. You create a policy that allows a specific user in the resource directory to request this access package.

2. In the **Users who can request access** section, click **For users not in your directory** and then click **All users (All connected organizations + any new external users)**.

3. Ensure that **Require approval** is set to **Yes**.

4. The following settings allow you to configure how your approvals work for your external users:

    * **Require requestor justification** – sets the Justification field on the requestor form to be required
    * **How many stages** – Allows you to configure multiple stages of approval for your external users
    * **Approver** – this field has three options:
      * **Internal sponsor** -  This option comes from a configured [Connected Org](entitlement-management-organization.md) where you can sponsors for specific organizations you're working with. This allows you to set someone specified in the Connected Org from within your organization to be the approver. 
      * **External sponsor** - This option allows you to set someone specified in the Connected Org from outside your organization to be the approver.
      * **Choose specific approver** – This option allows you to set specific people to be the approver.
    * **Decision must be made in how many days?** – Time limit for approvers.
    * **Require approver justification** – Approvers must fill in the justification field for their approvals in case you want to review later.

5.	Set **Enable new requests and assignments** to **Yes** to enable this access package to be requested as soon as it's created.

## Step 4: Configure Requestor information for your access package

1.	Click **Next** to open the **Requestor information** tab

2.	On this screen, you can ask additional questions to collect more information from your requestor. These questions are shown on their request form and can be set to required or optional.

3.	Fill in any questions that are necessary and configure the type of answer you would expect.

## Step 5: Configure the Lifecycle for your access package

1. Click **Next** to open the **Lifecycle** tab

2.	In the **Expiration** section, set **Access package assignment expire** to **Number of days**.

3.	Set **Assignment expire after** to **60** days. This field determines when your guest users will have to renew their access.

4.	You can also configure **Access Reviews** which allows periodic checks of whether the guest still needs access to the access package. A review can be a self-review or you can set specific reviews for this task. For more information, see [Access Reviews](entitlement-management-access-reviews-create.md).

## Step 6: Review and create your access package

1.	Click **Next** to open the **Review + Create** tab.

2.	On this screen, you can review the configuration for your access package before creating. If there are any issues, you can use the tabs to navigate to a specific point in the create experience to make edits.

3.	When you're happy with your selections, click on **Create**. After a few moments, you should see a notification that the access package was successfully created.

4.	Once created, you’ll be brought to the **Overview** page for your access package. You can find the **My Access portal link** and copy the value here. Share this link with your external users and they can go to request this package to start collaborating.
