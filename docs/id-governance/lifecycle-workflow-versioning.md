Workflows created using Lifecycle Workflows can be updated as needed to satisfy the needs of users as they move through their lifecycle in your organization. To manage updates in workflows, Lifecycle Workflows introduce the concept of workflow versioning and history. Understanding how workflow versioning is handled during the update process allows you to strategically set up workflows so that workflows tasks and conditions are always relevant for users the workflow runs for.
