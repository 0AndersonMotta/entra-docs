# Lifecycle Workflow built-in tasks (preview)

Lifecycle Workflows come with many pre-configured tasks that are designed to automate common lifecycle management scenarios. These pre-configured tasks can be paired together to make customized workflows to suit your organization's needs. While each task has common parameters that must be filled out such as a category, displayName, description, if a task error stops a workflow from running, and whether it's enabled, some tasks also have unique parameters which must be completed to run them in a workflow. In this article you'll get the complete list of tasks, information on common parameters each task has, and a list of unique parameters needed for each specific task.


## Supported tasks (preview)
 
Lifecycle Workflow's built-in tasks each include an identifier, known as **taskDefinitionID**, and can be used to create either new workflows from scratch, or inserted into workflow templates so that they fit the needs of your organization. For more information on templates available for use with Lifecycle Workflows, see: [Lifecycle Workflow Templates](lifecycle-workflow-templates.md).

Lifecycle Workflows currently support the following tasks:

|Task  |taskDefinitionID  |
|---------|---------|
|[Send welcome email to new hire](lifecycle-workflow-tasks.md#send-welcome-email-to-new-hire)     |   70b29d51-b59a-4773-9280-8841dfd3f2ea      |

## Common task parameters (preview)

Common task parameters are the non-unique parameters contained in every task. When adding tasks to a new workflow, or a workflow template, you can customize and configure these parameters so that they match your requirements.


|Parameter  |Definition  |
|---------|---------|
|category     |  A  read-only string that identifies the category or categories of the task. Automatically determined when the taskDefinitionID is chosen.     |
|taskDefinitionId     | A string referencing a taskDefinition which determines which task to run.       |
|isEnabled     | A boolean value that denotes whether the task is set to run or not. If set to â€œtrue" then the task will run.       |
|displayName     |  A unique string that identifies the task.       |
|description     | A string that describes the purpose of the task for administrative use. (Optional)         |
|executionSequence     | An integer that is read-only which states in what order the task will run in a workflow. For more information about executionSequence and workflow order, see: [Execution conditions](lifecycle-workflows-concept-parts.md#execution-conditions).       |
|continueOnError     |  A boolean value that determines if the failure of this task stops the subsequent workflows from running.        |
|arguments     |  Contains unique parameters relevant for the given task       |



## Task details (preview)

Below are each specific task, and detailed information such as parameters and prerequisites, required for them to run successfully. The parameters are noted as they appear both in the Azure portal, and within Microsoft Graph. For information about editing Lifecycle Workflow tasks in general, see: [Manage workflow Versions](manage-workflow-tasks.md).


### Send welcome email to new hire


Lifecycle Workflows allow you to automate the sending of welcome emails to new hires in your organization. You're able to customize the task name and description for this task in the Azure portal.
:::image type="content" source="media/lifecycle-workflow-task/lcw-email-task.png" alt-text="LCW Email task":::


The Azure AD prerequisite to run the **Send welcome email to new hire** task is:

- A populated mail attribute for the user.


For Microsoft Graph the parameters for the **Send welcome email to new hire** task are as follows:

|Parameter |Definition  |
|---------|---------|
|category    |  joiner      |
|displayName     | Send Welcome Email (Customizable by user)        |

            "arguments": []
        }

```

### Generate Temporary Access Password and send via email to user's manager

When a user joins your organization, Lifecycle Workflows allow you to automatically generate a Temporary Access Password(TAP) and have it sent to the new user's manager.

With this task in the Azure portal, you're able to give the task a name and description. You must also set the following:

**Activation duration**- How long the password is active.
**One time use**- If the password is one use only.
:::image type="content" source="media/lifecycle-workflow-task/lcw-TAP-task.png" alt-text="TAP LCW task":::
 

The Azure AD prerequisites to run the **Generate Temporary Access Password and send via email to user's manager** task are:

- A populated manager attribute for the user.
- A populated manager's mail attribute for the user.
 


For Microsoft Graph the parameters for the **Generate Temporary Access Password and send via email to user's manager** task are as follows:

|Parameter |Definition  |

Minimum 10, Maximum 43200 (equivalent to 30 days). The argument also contains the tapIsUsableOnce parameter, which determines whether the password is limited to a one time use. If true, the pass can be used once; if false, the pass can be used multiple times within the temporaryAccessPass lifetime.    |
