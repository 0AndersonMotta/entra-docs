# Lifecycle Workflow tasks and definitions (preview)

Lifecycle Workflows come with many pre-configured tasks that are designed to automate common lifecycle management scenarios. These pre-configured tasks, or task definitions, can be paired together to make customized workflows to suit your organization's needs. While each task has common parameters that must be filled out such as a category, displayName, description, if a task error stops a workflow from running, and whether it's enabled, some tasks also have unique parameters which must be completed to run them in a workflow. In this article you'll get the complete list of task definitions,
Information on common parameters each task has, and a list of unique parameters needed for each specific task.


## Supported task definitions (preview)
Lifecycle Workflows currently support the following task definitions:
