# Roles in Azure AD entitlement management (Preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) entitlement management is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

By default, Global administrators and User administrators can create and manage all aspects of Azure AD entitlement management. However, the users in these roles may not know all the scenarios where access packages are required. Typically it is users within departments who know who need to collaborate. 

Instead of granting unrestricted permissions to non-administrators, you can grant users the least permissions they need to perform their job and avoid creating conflicting or inappropriate access rights. This article describes the roles that you can assign in entitlement management. 

## Entitlement management roles

Entitlement management has the following roles that are specific to entitlement management.

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Catalog creator | Create and manage catalogs. Typically an IT administrator who is not a Global administrator, or a resource owner for a collection of resources. The person that creates a catalog automatically becomes the catalog's first catalog owner, and can add additional catalog owners. A catalog creator can’t manage or see catalogs that they don’t own and can’t add resources they don’t own to a catalog. If the catalog creator needs to manage another catalog or add resources they don’t own, they can request to be a co-owner of that catalog or resource. |
| Catalog owner | Edit and manage existing catalogs. Typically an IT administrator or resource owners, or a user who the catalog owner has designated. |
| Access package manager | Edit and manage all existing access packages within a catalog. |

In addition, a designated approver and a requestor of an access package also have rights, although they are not roles.
 
* Approver: Authorized by a policy to approve or deny requests to access packages, though they cannot change the access package definitions.
* Requestor: Authorized by a policy of an access package to request that access package.

The following table lists the tasks that these roles can perform.

| Task | Catalog creator | Catalog owner | Access package manager | Approver |

## Required roles to add resources to a catalog

A Global administrator can add or remove any group (cloud-created security groups or cloud-created Office 365 groups), application, or SharePoint Online site in a catalog. A User administrator can add or remove any group or application in a catalog.

For a user who is not a Global administrator or a User administrator, to add groups, applications, or SharePoint Online sites to a catalog, that user must have *both* the required Azure AD directory role and catalog owner entitlement management role. The following table lists the role combinations that are required to add resources to a catalog. To remove resources from a catalog, you must have the same roles.

| Azure AD directory role | Entitlement management role | Can add security group | Can add Office 365 group | Can add app | Can add SharePoint Online site |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [Global administrator](../users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles.md) | n/a |  :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [User administrator](../users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles.md) | n/a |  :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |  |
| [Intune administrator](../users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles.md) | Catalog owner | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |  |  |
| [Exchange administrator](../users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles.md) | Catalog owner |  | :heavy_check_mark: |  |  |
| [Teams service administrator](../users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles.md) | Catalog owner |  | :heavy_check_mark: |  |  |
| [SharePoint administrator](../users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles.md) | Catalog owner |  | :heavy_check_mark: |  | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [Application administrator](../users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles.md) | Catalog owner |  |  | :heavy_check_mark: |  |
| [Cloud application administrator](../users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles.md) | Catalog owner |  |  | :heavy_check_mark: |  |
| User | Catalog owner | Only if group owner | Only if group owner | Only if app owner |  |
