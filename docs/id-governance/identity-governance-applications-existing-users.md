#Customer intent: As an IT admin, I want to ensure access to specific applications is governed, by setting up access reviews for those applications.  For this, I need to have in Azure AD the existing users of that application assigned to the application, either directly or through an access package.

# Governing an application's existing users - Microsoft PowerShell

There are two common scenarios in which it's necessary to populate Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with existing users of an application, prior to using the application with an Azure AD identity governance feature such as [access reviews](access-reviews-application-preparation.md) or [entitlement management](entitlement-management-overview.md).

### Application migrating to Azure AD after using its own identity provider

The first scenario is one in which the application already exists in the environment, and previously used its own identity provider or data store to track which users had access. When you change the application to rely upon Azure AD, then only users who are in Azure AD and permitted access to that application can access it.  As part of that configuration change, you can choose to bring in the existing users from that application's data store into Azure AD, so that those users continue to have access, through Azure AD. Having the users associated with the application represented in Azure AD will enable Azure AD to track users with access to the application, even though the user's relationship with the application originated elsewhere, such as in an applications' database or directory.  Once Azure AD is aware of a user's assignment, Azure AD will be able send updates to the application's data store when that user's attributes change, or when the user goes out of scope of the application.

### Application that doesn't use Azure AD as its only identity provider

The second scenario is one in which an application doesn't solely rely upon Azure AD as its identity provider.  In some cases, an application might support multiple identity providers, or have its own built-in credential storage. This scenario is described as Pattern C in [preparing for an access review of user's access to an application](access-reviews-application-preparation.md). If it isn't feasible to remove other identity providers or local credential authentication from the application, then in order to be able to use Azure AD to review who has access to that application, or remove someone's access from that application, you'll need to create assignments in Azure AD that represent the access by users of the application, those users who don't rely upon Azure AD for authentication.  Having these assignments is necessary if you plan to review all users with access to the application, as part of an access review.

For example, there's a user who's in the application's data store and Azure AD is configured to require role assignments to the application, however, the user doesn't have an application role assignment in Azure AD.  If the user is updated in Azure AD, then no changes will be sent to the application. And if the application's role assignments are reviewed, the user won't be included in the review. To ensure users are included in the review, then it's necessary to have either application role assignments for all users of the application, or access package assignments for those users.

## Terminology

This article illustrates the process for managing application role assignments using the [Microsoft Graph PowerShell cmdlets](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.Graph) and so uses Microsoft Graph terminology.

![Terminology](./media/identity-governance-applications-existing-users/data-model-terminology.png)

In Azure AD, a `ServicePrincipal` represents an application in a particular organization's directory.  The `ServicePrincipal` has a property `AppRoles` that lists the roles an application supports, such as `Marketing specialist`.  An `AppRoleAssignment` links a `User` to a Service principal and specifies which role that user has in that application.

You can also choose to use the Azure AD entitlement management access packages to time-limit access. An `AccessPackage` contains one or more resource roles, potentially from multiple service principals, and has `Assignment` for users to the access package.  When you create an assignment for a user to an access package, then Azure AD entitlement management automatically creates the necessary `AppRoleAssignment` for the user to each application.

## Collect existing users from an application

The first step to ensure all users are recorded in Azure AD, is to collect the list of existing users who have access to the application.  Some applications may have a built-in command to export a list of current users from its data store. In other cases, the application may rely upon an external directory or database.  In some environments, the application may be located on a network segment or system that isn't appropriate for use for managing access to Azure AD, so you might need to extract the list of users from that directory or database, and then transfer it as a file to another system that can be used for Azure AD interactions.  This section explains three approaches for how to get a list of users, held in a comma separated text file (CSV),

* From an LDAP directory
* From a SQL Server database
* From another SQL-based database

### Collect existing users from an LDAP directory

This section applies to applications that use an LDAP directory as its underlying data store for users who do not authenticate to Azure AD.

Many LDAP directories, such as Active Directory, include a command that outputs a list of users.

1. Identify which of users in that directory are in scope of being users the application. This choice will be dependent upon your application's configuration. For some applications, any user who exists in an LDAP directory is a valid user.  Other applications may require the user to have a particular attribute, or be a member of a group in that directory.

1. Run the command that retrieves that subset of users from your directory. Ensure that the output includes the attributes of users that will be used for matching with Azure AD - such as an employee ID, account name or email address. For example, this command would produce a CSV file in the current directory with the `userPrincipalName` attribute of every person in the directory.

   ```powershell
   $out_filename = ".\users.csv"
   csvde -f $out_filename -l userPrincipalName,cn -r "(objectclass=person)"
   ```
1. If needed, transfer the CSV file containing the list of users to a system with the [Microsoft Graph PowerShell cmdlets](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.Graph) installed.
1. Continue reading at the section below, **Confirm Azure AD has users for each user from the application**.

### Collect existing users from a database table using a SQL Server wizard

This section applies to applications that use SQL Server as its underlying data store.

First, get a list of the users from the tables. Most databases provide a way to export the contents of tables to a standard file format, such as to a CSV file.  If the application uses a SQL Server database, you can use the **SQL Server Import and Export Wizard** to export portions of a database.  If you don't have a utility for your database, you can use the ODBC driver with PowerShell, described in the next section.

1. Log in to the system where SQL Server is installed.
1. Launch **SQL Server 2019 Import and Export (64 bit)** or the equivalent for your database.
1. Select the existing database as the source.
1. Select **Flat File Destination** as the destination.  Provide a file name, and change the **Code page** to **65001 (UTF-8)**.
1. Complete the wizard, and select to run immediately.
1. Wait for the execution to complete.
1. If needed, transfer the CSV file containing the list of users to a system with the [Microsoft Graph PowerShell cmdlets](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.Graph) installed.
1. Continue reading at the section below, **Confirm Azure AD has users for each user from the application**.

### Collect existing users from a database table using PowerShell

This section applies to applications that use another SQL database as its underlying data store, where you're using the [ECMA Connector Host](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/on-premises-sql-connector-configure) to provision users into that application.  If you've not yet configured the provisioning agent, use that guide to create the DSN connection file you'll use in this section.

1. Log in to the system where the provisioning agent is or will be installed.
1. Launch PowerShell.
1. Construct a connection string for connecting to your database system. The components of a connection string will depend upon the requirements of your database.  For example, if your database uses the pathname of the DSN file, a userID and password, then construct the connection string using the following commands.

   ```powershell
   $filedsn = ".\db.dsn"
   $db_cs = "filedsn=" + $filedsn + ";uid=postgres;pwd=secret"
   ```

1. Open a connection to your database, using the following commands.

   ```powershell
   $db_conn = New-Object data.odbc.OdbcConnection
   $db_conn.ConnectionString = $db_cs
   $db_conn.Open()
   ```

1. Construct a SQL query to retrieve the users from the database table.  Be sure to include the columns that will be used to match users in the application's database with those users in Azure AD, such as an employee ID, account name or email address.  For example, if your users are held in a database table named `USERS` and have columns `name` and `email`, then type the following command.

   ```powershell
   $db_query = "SELECT name,email from USERS"

   ```

1. Send the query to the database.

   ```powershell
   $result = (new-object data.odbc.OdbcCommand($db_query,$db_conn)).ExecuteReader()
   $table = new-object System.Data.DataTable
   $table.Load($result)
   ```

1. Write the result, the list of users retrieved from the query, to a CSV file.

   ```powershell
   $out_filename = ".\users.csv"
   $table.Rows | Export-Csv -Path $out_filename -NoTypeInformation -Encoding UTF8
   ```

1. If needed, transfer the CSV file that was generated in the previous step, containing the list of users, to a system with the [Microsoft Graph PowerShell cmdlets](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.Graph) installed.

## Confirm Azure AD has users for each user from the application

Now that you have a list of all the users obtained from the application, you'll next match those users from the application's data store with users in Azure AD.  Before proceeding, ensure that you have reviewed the section on [matching users in the source and target systems](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes#matching-users-in-the-source-and-target--systems) as you'll subsequently configure Azure AD provisioning with equivalent mappings.  That step will allow Azure AD provisioning to query the application's data store with the same matching rules.

### Retrieve the IDs of the users in Azure AD

This section illustrates how to interact with Azure AD using [Microsoft Graph PowerShell](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.Graph) cmdlets. The first time your organization use these cmdlets for this scenario, you'll need to be in a Global Administrator role to consent Microsoft Graph PowerShell to be used for these scenarios in your tenant.  Subsequent interactions can use a lower privileged role, such as User Administrator role if you anticipate creating new users, or the Application Administrator or [Identity Governance Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#identity-governance-administrator) role, if you're just managing application or access package assignments.

1. Launch PowerShell.
1. If you do not have the [Microsoft Graph PowerShell modules](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.Graph) already installed, install the `Microsoft.Graph.Users` module and others using

   ```powershell
   Install-Module Microsoft.Graph
   ```

1. Connect to Azure AD.

   The first time you run these scripts, you'll need to be an administrator, to be able to consent Microsoft Graph PowerShell for these permissions.

   ```powershell
   $msg = Connect-MgGraph -ContextScope Process -Scopes "User.Read.All,Application.Read.All,AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All,EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All"
   ```

1. Read the list of users obtained from the application's data store into the PowerShell session. If the list of users was in a CSV file, then you can use the PowerShell cmdlet `Import-Csv` and provide the filename of the file from the previous section as an argument. For example, if the file is named `users.csv` and located in the current directory, type the command

   ```powershell
   $filename = ".\users.csv"
   $dbusers = Import-Csv -Path $filename -Encoding UTF8
   ```

1. Pick the column of the `users` file that will match with an attribute of a user in Azure AD.

   For example, you might have users in the database where the value in the column named `Mail` is the same value as in the Azure AD attribute `Email`.

   ```powershell
   $db_match_column_name = "Mail"
   $azuread_match_attr_name = "Email"
   ```

1. Retrieve the IDs of those users in Azure AD.

   The following PowerShell script will use the `$dbusers`, `$db_match_column_name` and `$azuread_match_attr_name` specified above, and will query Azure AD to locate a user that has a matching value for each record in the source file.

   ```powershell
   $dbu_not_queried_list = @()
   $dbu_not_matched_list = @()
   $dbu_match_ambiguous_list = @()
   $dbu_query_failed_list = @()
   $azuread_match_id_list = @()

   foreach ($dbu in $dbusers) { 
      if ($null -ne $dbu.$db_match_column_name -and $dbu.$db_match_column_name.Length -gt 0) { 
         $val = $dbu.$db_match_column_name
         $escval = $val -replace "'","''"
         $filter = $azuread_match_attr_name + " eq '" + $escval + "'"
         try {
            $ul = @(Get-MgUser -Filter $filter -All -ErrorAction Stop)
            if ($ul.length -eq 0) { $dbu_not_matched += $dbu; } elseif ($ul.length -gt 1) {$dbu_match_ambiguous_list += $dbu } else {
               $id = $ul[0].id; 
               $azuread_match_id_list += $id;
            } 
         } catch { $dbu_query_failed_list += $dbu } 
       } else { $dbu_not_queried_list += $dbu }
   }

   ```

1. View the results of the previous queries to see if any of the users in the database couldn't be located in Azure AD, due to errors or missing matches.

   The following PowerShell script will display the counts of records that weren't located.

   ```powershell
   $dbu_not_queried_count = $dbu_not_queried_list.Count
   if ($dbu_not_queried_count -ne 0) {
     Write-Error "Unable to query for $dbu_not_queried_count records as rows lacked values for $db_match_column_name"
   }
   $dbu_not_matched_count = $dbu_not_matched_list.Count
   if ($dbu_not_matched_count -ne 0) {
     Write-Error "Unable to locate $dbu_not_matched_count records in Azure AD by querying for $db_match_column_name in $azuread_match_attr_name"
   }
   $dbu_match_ambiguous_count = $dbu_match_ambiguous_list.Count
   if ($dbu_match_ambiguous_count -ne 0) {
     Write-Error "Unable to locate $dbu_match_ambiguous_count records in Azure AD"
   }
   $dbu_query_failed_count = $dbu_query_failed_list.Count
   if ($dbu_query_failed_count -ne 0) {
     Write-Error "Unable to locate $dbu_query_failed_count records in Azure AD as queries returned errors"
   }
   if ($dbu_not_queried_count -ne 0 -or $dbu_not_matched_count -ne 0 -or $dbu_match_ambiguous_count -ne 0 -or $dbu_query_failed_count -ne 0) {
    Write-Output "You will need to resolve those issues before access of existing users can be reviewed."
   }
   $azuread_match_count = $azuread_match_id_list.Count
   Write-Output "Users corresponding to $azuread_match_count records were located in Azure AD." 
   ```

1. When the script completes, it will indicate an error if there were any records from the data source that weren't located in Azure AD.  If not all the records for users from the application's data store could be located as users in Azure AD, then you'll need to investigate which records didn't match and why.  For example, someone's email address may have been changed in Azure AD without their corresponding `mail` property being updated in the application's data source.  Or, they may have already left the organization, but still be in the application's data source.  Or there might be a vendor or super-admin account in the application's data source who does not correspond to any specific person in Azure AD.

1. If there were users that could not be located in Azure AD, but you want to have their access be reviewed or their attributes updated in the database, you'll need to create Azure AD users for the users that could not be located.

1. After adding any missing users to Azure AD, then run the script from step 6 above again, and ensure that no errors are reported.

## Check for users who are not already assigned to the application

The previous steps have confirmed that all the users in the application's data store exist as users in Azure AD.  However, they may not all currently be assigned to the application's roles in Azure AD.  So the next steps are to see which users don't have assignments to application roles.

1. Retrieve the users who currently have assignments to the application in Azure AD.

   For example, if the enterprise application is named `CORPDB1`, then type the following commands

   ```powershell
   $azuread_app_name = "CORPDB1"
   $azuread_sp_filter = "displayName eq '" + ($azuread_app_name -replace "'","''") + "'"
   $azuread_sp = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter $azuread_sp_filter -All
   $azuread_existing_assignments = @(Get-MgServicePrincipalAppRoleAssignedTo -ServicePrincipalId $azuread_sp.Id -All)
   ```

1. Compare the list of user IDs from the previous section to those users currently assigned to the application.

   ```powershell
   $azuread_not_in_role_list = @()
   foreach ($id in $azuread_match_id_list) {
      $found = $false
      foreach ($existing in $azuread_existing_assignments) {
         if ($existing.principalId -eq $id) {
            $found = $true; break;
         }
      }
      if ($found -eq $false) { $azuread_not_in_role_list += $id }
   }
   $azuread_not_in_role_count = $azuread_not_in_role_list.Count
   Write-Output "$azuread_not_in_role_count users in the application's data store are not assigned to the application roles."
   ```

   If 0 users aren't assigned to application roles, indicating that all users are assigned to application roles, then no further changes are needed before performing an access review.

   However, if one or more users aren't currently assigned to the application roles, you'll need to add them to one of the application's roles, either directly, or through an access package.

1. Select the role of the application to assign the remaining users to.

   An application may have more than one role.  Use this command to list the available roles.

   ```powershell
   $azuread_sp.AppRoles | where-object {$_.AllowedMemberTypes -contains "User"} | ft DisplayName,Id
   ```

   Select the appropriate role from the list, and obtain its role ID.  For example, if the role name is `Admin`, then provide that value in the following PowerShell commands.

   ```powershell
   $azuread_app_role_name = "Admin"
   $azuread_app_role_id = ($azuread_sp.AppRoles | where-object {$_.AllowedMemberTypes -contains "User" -and $_.DisplayName -eq $azuread_app_role_name}).Id
   ```

## Configure application provisioning

Before creating new assignments, you'll want to configure [Azure AD provisioning](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/user-provisioning) of Azure AD users to the application.  Configuring provisioning will enable Azure AD to match up the users in Azure AD with the application role assignments to the users already in the application's data store.

1. Ensure that the application is configured to require users to have application role assignments, so that only selected users will be provisioned to the application.
1. If provisioning has not yet been configured for the application, then configure, but do not start, [provisioning](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/user-provisioning).

   * If the application uses an LDAP directory, follow the guide for [configuring Azure AD to provision users into LDAP directories](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/on-premises-ldap-connector-configure).
   * If the application uses a SQL database, follow the guide for [configuring Azure AD to provision users into SQL based applications](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/on-premises-sql-connector-configure).

1. Check the [attribute mappings](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes) for provisioning to that application.  Make sure that *Match objects using this attribute* is set for the Azure AD attribute and column that you used in the sections above for matching.  If these rules aren't using the same attributes as you used earlier, then when application role assignments are created, Azure AD may be unable to locate existing users in the applications' data store, and inadvertently create duplicate users.
1. Check that there's an attribute mapping for **isSoftDeleted** to an attribute of the application.  When subsequently a user is unassigned from the application, soft-deleted in Azure AD, or blocked from sign-in, then Azure AD provisioning will update the attribute mapped to **isSoftDeleted**.  If no attribute is mapped, then users who are subsequently unassigned from the application role will continue to exist in the application's data store.
1. If provisioning has already been enabled for the application, ensure that the application provisioning is not in [quarantine](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status). You will need to resolve any issues that are causing the quarantine prior to proceeding.

## Create app role or access package assignments in Azure AD

Depending upon your organization's identity governance requirements and the Azure AD features you plan to use, choose the most appropriate model for representing existing user's access rights in Azure AD.  If you're just using provisioning to update existing users, or for reviewing their access, then you can create application role assignments.  However, if you plan to time-limit their existing access, and have Azure AD automatically remove access when a project ends, then you should create access package assignments.

* Create an application role assignment for each user who already has access to the application.

  This approach is appropriate if users are expected to remain in the application indefinitely, until removed by an external trigger (such as a termination from an HR system), or with an access review of that application.

  When an application role assignment is created in Azure AD for a user to application, then

    * Azure AD will query the application to determine if the user already exists.
    * Subsequent updates to the user's attributes in Azure AD will be sent to the application.
    * Users will remain in the application indefinitely, unless updated outside of Azure AD, or until the assignment in Azure AD is removed.
    * On the next review of that application's role assignments, the user will be included in the review.
    * If the user is denied in an access review, then their application role assignment will be removed, and Azure AD will notify the application that the user is blocked from sign in.

* Create an access package assignment for each user who already has access to the application, to an access package with one of the application's roles.

  This approach is appropriate if users should have only time-limited access.  For example, if existing users' access should be removed when a project ends on a particular date, then you can create an access package with a policy that will remove assignments on that date. You should also use an access package  if more than one service principal in your Azure AD tenant corresponds to the application.

  When an access package assignment is created in Azure AD for that user, to an access package including the application's roles, then

   * Azure AD entitlement management will create an application role assignment for that user.
   * Azure AD will query the application to determine if the user already exists.
   * Subsequent updates to the user's attributes in Azure AD will be sent to the application.
   * Users will remain in the application indefinitely, unless updated outside of Azure AD, or until the assignment in Azure AD is removed.
   * On the next review of that access package, the user will be included in the review.
   * If the user is denied in an access review of an access package, or the access package assignment expires, then their application role assignment will be removed, and Azure AD will notify the application that the user is blocked from sign in.

### Create application role assignments

In this section, you'll create application role assignments for those users who don't have them.

This section is only applicable if you aren't using entitlement management access package for this application. Because if application role assignments are created for a user, and then subsequently the user is assigned to an access package with that same application as one of its resources, Azure AD entitlement management will assume the lifecycle of the user's application role assignment isn't managed through Azure AD entitlement management.  If the user's assignment to the access package expires or is removed, then the application role assignment will remain. If you plan to use the access package assignment to determine when a user should lose access, then continue to the next section.

1. Create application role assignments for users who don't currently have role assignments.

   ```powershell
   foreach ($u in $azuread_not_in_role_list) {
      $res = New-MgServicePrincipalAppRoleAssignedTo -ServicePrincipalId $azuread_sp.Id -AppRoleId $azuread_app_role_id -PrincipalId $u -ResourceId $azuread_sp.Id 
   }
   ```

1. Wait 1 minute for changes to propagate within Azure AD.

1. Continue reading at the section below, **Check that Azure AD provisioning has matched the existing users**.

### Create access package assignments

In this section, you'll create access package assignments for users that don't have application role assignments.  Azure AD entitlement management itself will create application role assignments for those users.

1. Ensure that you have already created in entitlement management an access package with
   * an application role for the application
   * a direct assignment policy, which does not require approval

1. Retrieve the access package and its policies.

   ```powershell
   $ap_display_name = "Access to department's apps"
   $filter = "displayName eq '" + ($ap_display_name -replace "'","''") + "'"
   $ap = Get-MgEntitlementManagementAccessPackage -Filter $filter -ExpandProperty "assignmentPolicies" -All
   $ap_id = $ap.Id
   $ap.AssignmentPolicies | ft id,DisplayName
   ```

1. Select the ID of the access package assignment policy from the list displayed in the previous step. For example, if the direct assignment policy has ID `2264bf65-76ba-417b-a27d-54d291f0cbc8`, then type

   ```powershell
   $policy_id = "2264bf65-76ba-417b-a27d-54d291f0cbc8"
   ```

1. Create access package assignments for users who do not currently have access package assignments.  This will iterate through each of the user IDs of users not currently assigned to the application, and create an access package assignment request, specifying the access package and policy IDs.

   ```powershell
   $uri = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/assignmentRequests"
   foreach ($u in $azuread_not_in_role_list) {
      $a = @{}
      $a["targetId"] = $u
      $a["assignmentPolicyId"] = $policy_id
      $a["accessPackageId"] = $ap_id
      $req = @{}
      $req["requestType"] = "AdminAdd"
      $req["assignment"] = $a
      $req_json = $req | ConvertTo-json
      $res = invoke-MgGraphRequest -Method "POST" -Uri $uri -Body $req_json
   }
   ```

1. Wait for the access package assignments to convert to state delivered.

1. Check for any that were not delivered.

   ```powershell
   $af = "assignmentPolicy/Id eq '" + $policyid + "'"
   $allassign = Get-MgEntitlementManagementAssignment -ExpandProperty assignmentPolicy,target -all -Filter $af
   $notdelivered = $allassign | Where-Object {$_.State -ne "delivered" -and $_.State -ne "expired"} 
   $notdelivered | select-Object -Property State -ExpandProperty Target | ft State,ObjectId
   ```

1. If delivery failed for any of the users, then check the requests and the Azure AD audit log for errors in delivery.

## Check that Azure AD provisioning has matched the existing users

1. Requery Azure AD to obtain the updated list of role assignments.

   ```powershell
   $azuread_existing_assignments = @(Get-MgServicePrincipalAppRoleAssignedTo -ServicePrincipalId $azuread_sp.Id -All)
   ```

1. Compare the list of user IDs from the previous section to those users now assigned to the application.

   ```powershell
   $azuread_still_not_in_role_list = @()
   foreach ($id in $azuread_match_id_list) {
      $found = $false
      foreach ($existing in $azuread_existing_assignments) {
         if ($existing.principalId -eq $id) {
            $found = $true; break;
         }
      }
      if ($found -eq $false) { $azuread_still_not_in_role_list += $id }
   }
   $azuread_still_not_in_role_count = $azuread_still_not_in_role_list.Count
   if ($azuread_still_not_in_role_count -gt 0) {
      Write-Output "$azuread_still_not_in_role_count users in the application's data store are not assigned to the application roles."
   }
   ```

   If any users are not assigned to application roles, check the Azure AD audit log for an error from a previous step.

1. If the **Provisioning Status** of the application is **Off**, turn the **Provisioning Status** to **On**.
1. Based on the guidance for [how long will it take to provision users](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user#how-long-will-it-take-to-provision-users), wait for Azure AD provisioning to match the existing users of the application to those users just assigned.
1. Monitor the [provisioning status](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/check-status-user-account-provisioning) to ensure that all users were matched successfully.  If you do not see users being provisioned, check the troubleshooting guide for [no users being provisioned](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-config-problem-no-users-provisioned).  If you see an error in the provisioning status and are provisioning to an on-premises application, then check the [troubleshooting guide for on-premises application provisioning](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/on-premises-ecma-troubleshoot).

Once the users have been matched by the Azure AD provisioning service, based on the application role assignments you've created, then subsequent changes will be sent to the application.
