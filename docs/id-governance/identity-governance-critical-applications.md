# Govern access for critical applications

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Identity Governance allows you to balance your organization's need for security and employee productivity with the right processes and visibility. It provides you with capabilities to ensure that the right people have the right access to the right resources.

In most organizations subject to compliance requirements or that have a risk management plan, there will be some applications the organization is using, which are particularly sensitive or business-critical, based on the data it contains or the mission of the application. For those applications, only a subset of all the users in the organization will typically be authorized to have access, and access should only be permitted based on documented business requirements.  As part of your organization's controls for managing access, you can use Azure AD identity governance features to enforce access checks, and produce reports to demonstrate how those controls are being used to meet your compliance and risk management objectives.  (Identity governance features can also be used for other scenarios, such as [reviewing and removing users from other organizations](access-reviews-external-users.md) or [managing users who are excluded from Conditional Access policies](conditional-access-exclusion.md). )

Azure AD identity governance integrates with applications using standards such as OpenID Connect, SAML, SCIM, SQL and LDAP, and can be used with many popular SaaS applications, as well as on-premises applications, and applications which your organization has developed.  This five step deployment plan covers how to connect your application to Azure AD and enable identity governance features to be used for that application.

1. Establish policies for who should have access
1. Ensure unauthorized users cannot access the application
1. Review existing access to the application
1. Deploy policies for ongoing access assignments
1. Monitor to adjust policies and access as needed
