An access package enables you to do a one-time setup of resources and policies that automatically administers access for the life of the access package. As an access package manager, you can change the resources in an access package at any time without worrying about provisioning the user's access to the new resources, or removing their access from the previous resources. Policies can also be updated at any time, however, the policy changes only affect new accesses.

This article describes how to edit and manage existing access packages.

## Add a group resource role

You can add users to a group when they are assigned an access package. You can use any Office 365 group or Azure AD security group. Here are some considerations when selecting a group:

- When a group is part of an access package, then a user who is assigned that access package is added to that group, if not already present.
- When a user's access package assignment expires, they will be removed from the group, unless they they have access to another access package that includes that group.
- When a user is added to a group, they can see all the other members of that group.
- Azure AD cannot change the membership of a group that was synchronized from Windows Server Active Directory using Azure AD Connect.  
- The membership of dynamic groups cannot be updated using entitlement management.

**Prerequisite role:** User administrator, Catalog owner, or Access package manager

1. In the Azure portal, click **Azure Active Directory** and then click **Identity governance**.

1. In the left menu, click **Access packages** and then open the access package.

1. In the left menu, click **Resource roles**.

1. Click **Add resource roles**.

1. For **Resource type**, select **Group**.

1. For **Resource**, select a group that is available in the catalog.

    If you don't see the group you want to add in the list, follow the steps to [add the group to the catalog](entitlement-management-catalog-create.md).

1. For **Role**, select **Owner** or **Member**.

    You typically select the Member role. If you select the Owner role, that will allow users to add or remove other members or owners.

    ![Access package - Add resource role for a group](./media/entitlement-management-access-package-edit/resource-role-group.png)

1. Click **Add**.

    Any users with existing assignments to the access package will automatically be given access to this group when it is added.

## Add an application resource role

You can assign users access to an Azure AD enterprise application, including both SaaS applications and your own applications federated to Azure AD, when they are assigned an access package. For applications that integrate with Azure AD through federated single sign on, Azure AD will issue federation tokens for users assigned to the application. Here are some considerations when selecting an application:

- When an application's role is part of an access package, then a user who is assigned that access package is added to that application role, if not already present.
- When a user's access package assignment expires, their access will be removed from the application, unless they have access to another access package that includes that application.
- Applications can have multiple roles, as well as groups assigned to roles.

**Prerequisite role:** User administrator, Catalog owner, or Access package manager

1. In the Azure portal, click **Azure Active Directory** and then click **Identity governance**.

1. In the left menu, click **Access packages** and then open the access package.

1. In the left menu, click **Resource roles**.

1. Click **Add resource roles**.

1. For **Resource type**, select **Application**.

1. For **Resource**, select an application that is available in the catalog.

    If you don't see the application you want to add in the list, follow the steps to [add the application to the catalog](entitlement-management-catalog-create.md).

1. For **Role**, select an application role.

    ![Access package - Add resource role for an application](./media/entitlement-management-access-package-edit/resource-role-application.png)

1. Click **Add**.

    Any users with existing assignments to the access package will automatically be given access to this application when it is added.

## Add an SharePoint site resource role

You can assign users access to a SharePoint Online site or SharePoint Online site collection when they are assigned an access package.

**Prerequisite role:** User administrator, Catalog owner, or Access package manager

1. In the Azure portal, click **Azure Active Directory** and then click **Identity governance**.

1. In the left menu, click **Access packages** and then open the access package.

1. In the left menu, click **Resource roles**.

1. Click **Add resource roles**.

1. For **Resource type**, select **SharePoint site**.

1. For **Resource**, select a SharePoint site that is available in the catalog.

    If you don't see the SharePoint site you want to add in the list, follow the steps to [add the SharePoint site to the catalog](entitlement-management-catalog-create.md).

1. For **Role**, select a SharePoint site role.

    ![Access package - Add resource role for a SharePoint site](./media/entitlement-management-access-package-edit/resource-role-sharepoint-site.png)

1. Click **Add**.

    Any users with existing assignments to the access package will automatically be given access to this SharePoint site when it is added.

## Remove resource roles

**Prerequisite role:** User administrator, Catalog owner, or Access package manager

1. In the Azure portal, click **Azure Active Directory** and then click **Identity governance**.

1. In the left menu, click **Access packages** and then open the access package.

1. In the left menu, click **Resource roles**.

1. Click the ellipsis (**...**) and then click **Remove resource role**.

    Any users with existing assignments to the access package will automatically have their access revoked to this resource role when it is removed.

## Add a new policy

The way you specify who can request an access package is to create a policy. You can create multiple policies for a single access package if you want to allow different sets of users to be granted assignments with different approval and expiration settings. A single policy cannot be used to assign internal and external users to the same access package. However, you can create two policies in the same access package -- one for internal users and one for external users. If there are multiple policies that apply to a user, they will be prompted at the time of their request to select the policy they would like to be assigned to.

The following diagram shows the high-level process to create a policy for an existing access package.

## Copy My Access portal link

Most users in your directory can sign in to the My Access portal and automatically see a list of access packages they can request. However, for external business partner users that are not yet in your directory, you will need to send them a link that they can use to request an access package. As long as the access package is enabled for external users and you have a policy for the external user's directory, the external user can use the My Access portal link to request the access package.

**Prerequisite role:** User administrator, Catalog owner, or Access package manager

1. In the Azure portal, click **Azure Active Directory** and then click **Identity governance**.

1. In the left menu, click **Access packages** and then open the access package.

1. On the Overview page, copy the **My Access portal link**.

    ![Access package overview - My Access portal link](./media/entitlement-management-shared/my-access-portal-link.png)

1. Email or send the link to your external business partner. They can share the link with their users to request the access package.

## Change the Hidden setting

Access packages are discoverable by default. This means that if a policy allows a user to request the access package, they will automatically see the access package listed in their My Access portal.

**Prerequisite role:** User administrator, Catalog owner, or Access package manager

1. In the Azure portal, click **Azure Active Directory** and then click **Identity governance**.

1. In the left menu, click **Access packages** and then open the access package.

1. On the Overview page, click **Edit**.

1. Set the **Hidden** setting.

    If set to **No**, the access package will be listed in the user's My Access portal.

    If set to **Yes**, the access package will not be listed in the user's My Access portal. The only way a user can view the access package is if they have the direct **MyAccess portal link** to the access package.

## Delete

An access package can only be deleted if it has no active user assignments.

**Prerequisite role:** User administrator, Catalog owner, or Access package manager

1. In the Azure portal, click **Azure Active Directory** and then click **Identity governance**.

1. In the left menu, click **Access packages** and then open the access package.

1. In the left menu, click **Assignments** and remove access for all users.

1. In the left menu, click **Overview** and then click **Delete**.

1. In the delete message that appears, click **Yes**.
