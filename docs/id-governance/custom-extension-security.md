# Best practices for securing the custom extension extensibility to Azure Logic Apps

This article describes the best practices for securing the Microsoft Entra ID Governance custom extension extensibility to Azure Logic Apps. The guidance is specific to [Entitlement Management](../id-governance/entitlement-management-logic-apps-integration.md) and [Lifecycle Workflows](../id-governance/lifecycle-workflow-extensibility.md) and complementary to the [general security guidance](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-securing-a-logic-app?tabs=azure-portal) published for Azure Logic Apps.

## Prerequisites

TODO: List the prerequisites

<!-- 4. Task H2s ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Multiple procedures should be organized in H2 level sections. A section contains a major grouping of steps that help users complete a task. Each section is represented as an H2 in the article.

For portal-based procedures, minimize bullets and numbering.

* Each H2 should be a major step in the task.
* Phrase each H2 title as "<verb> * <noun>" to describe what they'll do in the step.
* Don't start with a gerund.
* Don't number the H2s.
* Begin each H2 with a brief explanation for context.
* Provide a ordered list of procedural steps.
* Provide a code block, diagram, or screenshot if appropriate
* An image, code block, or other graphical element comes after numbered step it illustrates.
* If necessary, optional groups of steps can be added into a section.
* If necessary, alternative groups of steps can be added into a section.

<!-- 5. Next step/Related content------------------------------------------------------------------------

Optional: You have two options for manually curated links in this pattern: Next step and Related content. You don't have to use either, but don't use both.
  - For Next step, provide one link to the next step in a sequence. Use the blue box format
  - For Related content provide 1-3 links. Include some context so the customer can determine why they would click the link. Add a context sentence for the following links.
