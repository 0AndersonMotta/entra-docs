An access package enables an access package manager to do a one-time setup or resources and policies that automatically administers access and the access lifecycle. The access package manager can change the resources without worrying about provisioning the user's access to the new resources, or removing their access from the previous resources. Policies can also be updated at any time, however, the policy changes only affect new accesses.

## Create an access package

**Prerequisite role:** User administrator or Catalog owner

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and open the **Identity Governance** page.

1. Click **Access packages**.

1. Click **New access package**.

1. On the **Details** tab, provide a display name and description for the access package. Users will see this information for the access package.

1. Set the **Discoverable** setting to **Yes** or **No**.

    Access packages are discoverable by default. This means that if a policy allows a user to request the access package, they will automatically see the access package listed in their My Access portal.

    If set to **Yes**, the access package will be listed in the user's My Access portal.

    If set to **No**, the access package will not be listed in the user's My Access portal. The only way a user can view the access package is if they have the direct URL to the access package.

1. For the **Select catalog** drop-down list, select the catalog you would like to create the access package in.

    - **Default catalog**
        - Prerequisites: User administrator
        - If you do not want to delegate management of the access package to a set of assigned Catalog owners, then click **No** to the ______. This will create the access package in the Default catalog.
    - Existing catalog
        - Prerequisites: User administrator, Catalog owner, Access package manager
        - Select the catalog you would like to create the access package in from the drop down. You will only be shown catalogs you have permission to build access packages in.
    - New catalog
        - Prerequisites: User administrator, Catalog creator
        - If you would like to create your access package in a new catalog, click **Yes** to the ________.
        - In the catalog section, click **Create new**. Enter the Catalog name and description and click **Create**.
        - The access package you are creating and any resources included in it will be added to the new catalog. Additionally, you will automatically become the first owner of the catalog. You can add additional catalog owners.

1. Click **Next** to open the **Permissions** tab.

    On this tab, you select the resource roles to be include in the access package.

1. Click the resource type you want to add and select one or more resources from the list.

    If you are creating the access package in the default catalog or a new catalog, you will be able to pick any resource from the directory that you own.

    - Prerequisites User administrator, Catalog creator

    If you are creating the access package in an existing catalog, you can select any resource that is already in the catalog without owning it.

    If you are a User administrator, or Catalog Owner, you have the additional option of selecting resources you own that are not yet in the catalog. If added to the access package, these resources will also be added to the catalog for other catalog admins to build access packages with.

    Once you have selected the resources, you must choose which role you would like access for the resource to be assigned for.

1. Select if you want to allow users in your directory or users not in your directory to request the access package. You can also choose to create a policy later.

    To allow people to request the access package, you must create its first policy. You can always create more policies to allow additional groups of users to request the access package with certain approval and expiration settings.

    - For users in your directory:

        Select one or more users and/or groups you would like to be able to request the access package.

    - For users not in your directory:

        Directories must be configured to be allowed in the **Organizational relationships collaboration restrictions** settings.

1. Select one or more external Azure AD directories whose users you would like to be able to request the access package. All users from the directory will be able to request.

1. Search for an external Azure AD directory by domain. Verify it is the correct directory by the provided directory name and initial domain. Click **Add**. Repeat this step to add any more directories.

    Users from all domain associated with the directory, not just the domain used in the search, will be able to request the access package

1. Once you have added all directories you'd like to include in the policy, click **Select**.

1. In request settings, to require approval on requests from the selected users, click **Yes** and select one or more users and/or groups to be approvers for requests from the users in this specific policy.

    Only one of the selected approvers needs to approve a request. Approval from all approvers is not required. The approval decision is based on whichever approver reviews the request first.

1. To have requests automatically approved, click **No**.

1. In advanced request settings, specify whether to require users to provide a justification to request the access package.

1. Specify whether to require the approver to provide a justification to approve a request for the access package.

1. Select the amount of time the approvers have to review a request. If no  approvers review it in this amount of days, the request will be cancelled and the user will have to re-request the access package.

1. In expiration settings, specify whether to expire a user's assignment to the access package on a certain date, a certain number of days after they are approved, or never.

1. In advanced expiration settings, specify whether to allow users to extend their assignments. If extensions are allowed, the user will receive an email 14 and 1 days before their access package assignment is set to expire prompting them to extend the assignment.

1. If you want to require approval for extensions, click **Yes**.

    Any extensions will require approval from one of the assigned approvers in the policy.

1. If you want the access package to be made immediately available to the users in the policy, click **Yes** to enable the policy.

    You can always enable it in the future after you have finished creating the access package.

1. Click **Review + create**.

1. Check that all of the access package's settings are correct and click **Create** to create the access package.

## Add resource roles to an access package

**Prerequisite role:** User administrator, Catalog owner, or Access package manager

1. In the Azure portal, open the access package.

1. Click **Resource roles**.

1. Click **Add resource roles**.

1. Select the resources you want to add.

1. Select the role.

1. Click **Add**.

Any users with existing assignments to the access package will automatically be given access to this resource role when it is added.

## Remove resource roles from an access package

**Prerequisite role:** User administrator, Catalog owner, or Access package manager

1. In the Azure portal, open the access package.

1. Click **Resource roles**.

1. Click the ellipsis (**...**) and then click **Remove resource role**.

Any users with existing assignments to the access package will automatically have their access revoked to this resource role when it is removed.

## Specify who can request an access package

The way you specify who can request an access package is to create a policy. You can create multiple policies for a single access package if you want to allow different sets of users to be granted assignments with different approval and expiration settings. If there are multiple policies that apply to a user, they will be prompted at the time of their request to select the policy they would like to be assigned to.

**Prerequisite role:** User administrator, Catalog owner, or Access package manager

1. In the Azure portal, open the access package.

1. Click **Policies** and then **Add policy**.

1. Select the type of users you would like to be able to request your access package. You can also choose to directly assign users to the access package with this policy.

    - For users in your directory:

        Select one or more users and/or groups you would like to be able to request the access package.

    - For users not in your directory:

        Directories must be configured to be allowed in the **Organizational relationships collaboration restrictions** settings.

1. Select one or more external Azure AD directories whose users you would like to be able to request the access package. All users from the directory will be able to request.

1. Search for an external Azure AD directory by domain. Verify it is the correct directory by the provided directory name and initial domain. Click **Add**. Repeat this step to add any more directories.

    Users from all domain associated with the directory, not just the domain used in the search, will be able to request the access package.

1. Once you have added all directories you'd like to include in the policy, click **Select**.

1. Choose the **No one (admin directly assigns)** option if you want to bypass requests and directly assign users to the access package. You can still set expiration settings, but there are no request settings.

1. In request settings, to require approval on requests from the selected users, click **Yes** and select one or more users and/or groups to be approvers for requests from the users in this specific policy.

    Only one of the selected approvers needs to approve a request. Approval from all approvers is not required. The approval decision is based on whichever approver reviews the request first.

    To have requests automatically approved, click **No**.

1. In advanced request settings, specify whether to require users to provide a justification to request the access package.

1. Specify whether to require the approver to provide a justification to approve a request for the access package.

1. Select the amount of time the approvers have to review a request. If no  approvers review it in this amount of days, the request will be cancelled and the user will have to re-request the access package.

1. In expiration settings, specify whether to expire a user's assignment to the access package on a certain date, a certain number of days after they are approved, or never.

1. In advanced expiration settings, specify whether to allow users to extend their assignments. If extensions are allowed, the user will receive an email 14 and 1 days before their access package assignment is set to expire prompting them to extend the assignment.

1. If you want to require approval for extensions, click **Yes**.

    Any extensions will require approval from one of the assigned approvers in the policy.

1. If you want the access package to be made immediately available to the users in the policy, click **Yes** to enable the policy.

    You can always enable it in the future after you have finished creating the access package.
