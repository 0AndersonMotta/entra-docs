# Update or remove an assigned Azure AD custom role in Privileged Identity Management

Azure AD Privileged Identity Management now supports just-in-time and time-bound assignment to custom roles created for Application Management in the Identity and Access Management administrative experience. View the details here [insert link to Vinceâ€™s docs] to learn more about and create custom roles for delegated application management.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure AD custom roles are not integrated with the built-in directory roles during preview. Once the capability is generally available, role management will appear as in the built-in roles experience.
