# Troubleshoot a problem with Privileged Identity Management

Are you having a problem with Privileged Identity Management in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)? The information that follows can help you to get things working again.

## Access to Azure resources denied

### Problem

You get an authorization error when you try to make a user eligible for an Azure AD admin role and you are unable to access Azure resources under Privileged Identity Management, You are unable to access Azure resources under Privileged Identity Management even if you are a Global admin and the owner of the subscription.

### Cause

This can happen when the User Access Administrator role for the MS-PIM service principal name was accidentally removed from the subscription. To assign roles, the MS-PIM service principal must be assigned the [User Access Administrator role](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator) in Azure role-based access control for Azure resource access (Azure RBAC). For the Privileged Identity Management service to be able to access Azure resources,the MS-PIM service principal should always have a User Access Administrator role assigned on an Azure subscription.

### Resolution

Assign the User Access Administrator role to the Privileged identity Management service principal name (MSâ€“PIM) at the subscription level, which should allow the Privileged identity Management service to access the Azure resources. Be aware that the role can be assigned on a management group level or at the subscription level, based on the requirements and setup of your Azure AD organization.
