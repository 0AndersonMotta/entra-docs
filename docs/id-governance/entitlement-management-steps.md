# Common steps in Azure AD entitlement management (Preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) entitlement management is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.

There are several ways that you can configure entitlement management for your organization. However, if you are just getting started, it's helpful to understand the common steps for administrators, approvers, and users.

## Administrator setup

### Allow users in your directory to request resources

- Users in your directory in specific groups can request access
- Time-limited access
- Approval process

> [!div class="mx-tableFixed"]
> | Step | Example | Who can perform |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | **1.** Open entitlement management | ![Azure portal icon](./media/entitlement-management-overview/icon-azure-portal.png) | User admin<br/>Catalog owner |
> | **2.** Add resources to a catalog<ul><li>Groups</li><li>Applications</li><li>SharePoint sites</li></ul> | ![Add resources to catalog](./media/entitlement-management-overview/icon-resources.png) | User admin<br/>Catalog owner |
> | **3.** Create an access package in catalog | ![Create an access package](./media/entitlement-management-overview/icon-access-package.png) | User admin<br/>Catalog owner |
> | **4.** Add resource roles to access package | ![Add resource roles](./media/entitlement-management-overview/icon-resource-roles.png) | User admin<br/>Catalog owner<br/>Access package manager |
> | **5.** Create a policy<ul><li>For users in your directory</li><li>Require approval</li><li>Expiration settings</li></ul> | ![Add policy](./media/entitlement-management-overview/icon-policy.png) | User admin<br/>Catalog owner<br/>Access package manager |

### Allow users in your directory to request resources managed by another department

- Users in your directory in specific groups can request access
- Another department will manage the resources that can be requested
- Time-limited access
- Approval process

> [!div class="mx-tableFixed"]
> | Step | Example | Who can perform |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | **1.** Open entitlement management | ![Azure portal icon](./media/entitlement-management-overview/icon-azure-portal.png) | User admin<br/>Catalog creator |
> | **2.** If necessary, create a new catalog for the department |![Create catalog](./media/entitlement-management-overview/icon-catalog.png) | User admin<br/>Catalog creator |
> | **3.** Add catalog owners |  | User admin<br/>Catalog owner |
> | **4.** Add resources to catalog<ul><li>Groups</li><li>Applications</li><li>SharePoint sites</li></ul> | ![Add resources to catalog](./media/entitlement-management-overview/icon-resources.png) | User admin<br/>Catalog owner |
> | **5.** Create an access package in catalog | ![Create an access package](./media/entitlement-management-overview/icon-access-package.png) | User admin<br/>Catalog owner |
> | **6.** Add resource roles to access package | ![Add resource roles](./media/entitlement-management-overview/icon-resource-roles.png) | User admin<br/>Catalog owner<br/>Access package manager |
> | **7.** Create a policy<ul><li>For users in your directory</li><li>Require approval</li><li>Expiration settings</li></ul> | ![Add policy](./media/entitlement-management-overview/icon-policy.png) | User admin<br/>Catalog owner<br/>Access package manager |

### Directly assign users in your directory to resources

- No users in your directory can request access
- Time-limited access
- No approval process

> [!div class="mx-tableFixed"]
> | Step | Example | Who can perform |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | **1.** Open entitlement management | ![Azure portal icon](./media/entitlement-management-overview/icon-azure-portal.png) | User admin<br/>Catalog owner<br/>Access package manager |
> | **2.** Open the access package | ![Add resource roles](./media/entitlement-management-overview/icon-resource-roles.png) | User admin<br/>Catalog owner<br/>Access package manager |
> | **3.** Create a policy<ul><li>None (admin direct assignments only)</li><li>Expiration settings</li></ul> | ![Add policy](./media/entitlement-management-overview/icon-policy.png) | User admin<br/>Catalog owner<br/>Access package manager |
> | **4.** Create an assignment to add the users to the access package<ul><li>Start and end dates</li></ul> | ![Add policy](./media/entitlement-management-overview/icon-policy.png) | User admin<br/>Catalog owner<br/>Access package manager |

> | **3.** Create an access package in catalog | ![Create an access package](./media/entitlement-management-overview/icon-access-package.png) | User admin<br/>Catalog owner |
> | **4.** Add resource roles to access package | ![Add resource roles](./media/entitlement-management-overview/icon-resource-roles.png) | User admin<br/>Catalog owner<br/>Access package manager |
