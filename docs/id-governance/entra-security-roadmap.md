# Azure Active Directory governance roadmap

It can seem daunting to deploy Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for your organization and keep it secure. This article identifies some common tasks that customers find helpful to complete over the course of 30 days, 90 days, or beyond to enhance their security posture. Even organizations who have already deployed Azure AD can 

A well-planned and executed identity infrastructure paves the way for stronger security and access to your productivity workloads and their data only by authenticated users and devices.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have Azure AD Premium P2 licenses, Enterprise Mobility + Security E5, Microsoft 365 E5, or an equivalent license bundle.

[Azure AD licensing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/)

[Microsoft 365 Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/microsoft-365-enterprise.aspx)

[Enterprise Mobility + Security](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/enterprise-mobility-security.aspx)

## Plan and deploy: Day 1-30

- Designate more than one global administrator (break glass account)
   - Refer to this doc: [DOC](/users-groups-roles/directory-emergency-access.md)
- Turn on Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to view reports [DOC](/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-getting-started.md)
- Use non-global administrative roles where possible.
   - [DOC](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles.md)
   - Which specific features are needed, then you are likely needed to configure the following. Base it off golden config as an example?
- Turn on Identity Protection to view reports [DOC](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/enable.md)
   - Remediate the users at risk (admin activity in the portal)
   - Take action on risky sign-ins (admin activity in the portal)

      - Do not expire passwords, do not require long passwords, password complexity replaced by password protection https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/password-guidance/
      - Password writeback (Included in Azure AD Connect)
   - Deploy Password Protection (preview) [DOC](/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-password-ban-bad.md)
   - For ADFS, use Smart Lockout (2016) or Extranet Lockout (2012)
      - Why we do not recommend account lockout policies (not a modern way of managing accounts)
      - Azure AD Smart Lockout for non-ADFS [DOC](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-password-smart-lockout.md)
   - CA based MFA [DOC](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted.md)
   - SSPR/MFA Converged registration [DOC](/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-converged.md)
- Azure AD Connect (PHS) [DOC](/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect#install-azure-ad-connect.md)
   - Implement Password Hash Sync [DOC](/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-implement-password-hash-synchronization.md)
   - Implement Passwrod Writeback [DOC](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-sspr-writeback.md)
   - Implement Azure AD Connect Health [DOC](/azure/active-directory/connect-health/active-directory-aadconnect-health.md)

## Plan and deploy: Day 31-90

   - Allow or deny specific domains [DOC](/azure/active-directory/b2b/allow-deny-list.md)
- Enable Windows Hello for Business on all Windows 10 PCs + Authenticator App for passwordless [DOC](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-identity-verification.md)

## Plan and deploy: Day 90 and beyond

- Remove just in time access eligible admins that no longer need access
