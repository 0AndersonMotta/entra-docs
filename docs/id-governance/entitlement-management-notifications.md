Azure AD entitlement management sends email notifications to key stakeholders for the request and approval process of access packages. These emails might also include links to relevant tasks.

This article describes what these emails look like, when they are sent, and who receives them.

## Access request emails

When a user submits an access request to an access package that is configured to require approval, all approvers configured in the policy receive an email notification with details of the request. Details include the user's name, organization, access start and end date if provided, business justification, when the request was submitted, and when the request will expire. The email includes a link where approvers can approve or deny the access request. Here is a sample email notification that is sent to an approver when a user submits an access request.

## Approve or deny emails

Users are notified when their access request is approved and available for access, or when their access request is denied. When an approver reviews an access request submitted by a user, they can approve or deny the access request. The approver needs to add a business justification for their decision.

When an access request is approved, entitlement management starts the process of granting the user access to each of the resources in the access package. After the user has been granted access to every resource in the access package, an email notification is sent to the user that their access request was approved and that they now have access to the access package. Here is a sample email notification that is sent to a user when they are granted access to an access package.

When an access request is denied, an email notification is sent to the user. Here is a sample email notification that is sent to a user when their access request is denied.

## Expired access request emails

Users are notified when their access request has expired (timed-out). When a user submits an access request, the request has a request duration after which it expires. If there are no approvers who submit an approve/deny decision, the request continues to remain in a pending approval state. When the request reaches its configured expiration duration, the request expires, and can no longer be approved or denied by the approvers. In this case, the request goes into an expired state. An expired request can no longer be approved or denied. An email notification is sent to the user that their access request has expired, and that they need to resubmit the access request. Here is a sample email notification that is sent to a user when their access request has expired.
