## Partner-driven application integrations

Microsoft Entra ID Governance allows you to balance your organization's need for security and employee productivity with the right processes and visibility, across hundreds of [Microsoft Entra ID Governance integrations with applications](apps.md). These application integrations are used to automate identity lifecycle management, through protocols such as System for Cross domain Identity Management (SCIM). Using applications that support SCIM simplify implementing governance controls across your organization, as Microsoft Entra can send changes to the applications for user and group provisioning, update, and deprovisioning.

In cases where an application doesn't support SCIM, partners have built gateways between Microsoft Entra outbound provisioning and those applications. For a list of applications integrated through a partner offering, see [partner-driven integrations](~/identity/app-provisioning/partner-driven-integrations.md).
