# Call the Microsoft Graph API from an Android app

This guide demonstrates how a native Android application can get an access token and call the Microsoft Graph API or other APIs that require access tokens from an Azure Active Directory v2 endpoint.

When you've completed the guide, your application will be able to call a protected API that uses personal accounts (including outlook.com, live.com, and others). The application will also use work and school accounts from any company or organization that uses Azure Active Directory.  

## How this sample works
![How this sample works](media/active-directory-develop-guidedsetup-android-intro/android-intro.png)

The sample application that you create with this guide is based on a scenario where an Android application is used to query a Web API that accepts tokens from Azure Active Directory v2 endpoint--in this case, Microsoft Graph API. For this scenario, you add a token to HTTP requests via the Authorization header. Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) handles token acquisition and renewal.

## Prerequisites
* This setup guide is focused on Android Studio, but any other Android application development environment is also acceptable. 
* Android SDK 21 or later is required (SDK 25 is recommended).
* Google Chrome or a web browser that uses Custom Tabs is required for this release of MSAL for Android.

> [!NOTE]
> Google Chrome is not included with Visual Studio Emulator for Android. We recommend that you test this code on an Emulator with API 25 or an image with API 21 or newer that has Google Chrome installed.

## Handling token acquisition for accessing protected Web APIs

After the user is authenticated, the sample application receives a token that can be used to query Microsoft Graph API or a Web API that's secured by Azure Active Directory v2.

APIs such as Microsoft Graph require a token to allow access to specific resources. For example, a token is required to read a user’s profile, access a user’s calendar, or send email. Your application can request an access token by using MSAL to access these resources by specifying API scopes. This access token is then added to the HTTP Authorization header for every call that's made against the protected resource. 

MSAL manages caching and refreshing access tokens for you, so that your application doesn't need to.
