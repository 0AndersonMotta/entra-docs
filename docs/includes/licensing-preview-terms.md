Microsoft Entra may include preview, beta, or other prerelease features, services, software, or regions offered by Microsoft to obtain customer feedback ("Previews"). Previews are made available to you on the condition that you agree to these terms of use, which supplement [your agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/) governing use of Microsoft Entra.

PREVIEWS ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS," "WITH ALL FAULTS," AND "AS AVAILABLE," AND ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS AND LIMITED WARRANTY. Microsoft Entra previews are covered by customer support. Previews may be subject to reduced or different security, compliance and privacy commitments, as further explained in the [Microsoft Online Services Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement), [Microsoft Azure Trust Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/trusted-cloud/), the [Online Services Terms](https://aka.ms/licensingdocs), and any other notices provided with the Preview. Customers shouldn't use Previews to process Personal Data or other data subject to heightened compliance requirements. Certain named Previews may also be subject to additional terms set forth below, if any. We may change or discontinue Previews at any time without notice. We also may choose not to release a Preview into "General Availability." 

Microsoft Entra provides updates and new features in the form of preview programs. Microsoft rolls out previews in phases to give Microsoft and customers the opportunity to evaluate and understand the new feature before it becomes part of the standard service of Microsoft Entra. The phases are as follows: 

1. **Private preview** During this phase we invite a few customers to take part in early access to new concepts and features. This phase does not include formal support. 

1. **Public preview** During this phase we allow any customer with the proper Microsoft Entra license to evaluate the new feature. Microsoft Customer Support Services will supply support services during this phase, but normal service level agreements don't apply. For new features exposed in the Microsoft Entra portal, customers can expect to see information banners in the user interface that draw attention to the new experience available during the preview. By clicking on the information banner customers then opt in to the preview experience.  

1. **Generally available (GA)** After the public preview is completed, the feature is open for any licensed customer to use and is supported via all Microsoft support channels. Be aware when a new feature impacts existing functionality, it might change the way you or your users use the functionality. 
Every Microsoft Entra preview program has different opt-in requirements and dependencies.
