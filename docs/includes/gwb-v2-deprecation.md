>[!IMPORTANT]
>The public preview of Group Writeback V2 (GWB) in Entra Connect Sync will no longer be available after **June 30, 2024**. This feature will be discontinued on this date, and you will no longer be supported in Connect Sync to provision cloud security groups to AD.  
>
>We offer a similar functionality in Entra Cloud Sync called [Group Provision to Active Directory](~/identity/hybrid/cloud-sync/how-to-configure-entra-to-active-directory.md) that you can use instead of GWB V2 for provisioning cloud security groups to AD. We are working on enhancing this functionality in Cloud Sync along with other new features that we are developing in Cloud Sync. 
>
>Customers who use this preview feature in Connect Sync should [switch their configuration from Connect Sync to Cloud Sync](https://aka.ms/GWBV2toGPADCS). You may choose to move all your hybrid sync to Cloud Sync (if it supports your needs) or you may run Cloud Sync side-by-side and move only cloud security group provisioning to AD onto Cloud Sync. 
>
>For customers who provision M365 groups to AD, you can keep using GWB V1 for this capability.   
>
>You can evaluate moving exclusively to Cloud Sync by using this wizard: https://aka.ms/EvaluateSyncOptions
