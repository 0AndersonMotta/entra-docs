To install the connector:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as an application administrator of the directory that uses Application Proxy. For example, if the tenant domain is contoso.com, the admin should be admin@contoso.com or any other admin alias on that domain.
1. Select your username in the upper-right corner. Verify you're signed in to a directory that uses Application Proxy. If you need to change directories, select **Switch directory** and choose a directory that uses Application Proxy.
1. In left navigation panel, select **Azure Active Directory**.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Application proxy**.
1. Select **Download connector service**.
