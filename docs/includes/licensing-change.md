>[!NOTE] 
> Starting September 1st, the Microsoft Entra ID Admin Center and the Microsoft Azure Portal will no longer support the assignment of licenses through their user interfaces. To manage license assignments for users and groups, administrators are required to utilize the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. This update is designed to streamline the license management process within the Microsoft ecosystem. This change is limited to the user interface. API and PowerShell access remain unaffected. For detailed guidance on assigning licenses using the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, refer to the following resources: 
    - [Assign or Unassign Licenses for Users in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users)
    - [Add Users and Assign Licenses in Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users)
    - [Assign Licenses to a Group Using the Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/licensing-groups-assign)
We encourage all administrators to familiarize themselves with the new procedures to ensure a smooth transition. For any further assistance or inquiries, please contact our support team.
