Microsoft Entra Verified ID is included with any Microsoft Entra ID subscription, including Microsoft Entra ID free, at no extra cost. Core Verified ID functionality help organizations:

- Verify and issue organizational credentials for any unique identity attributes.
- Empower end-users with ownership of their digital credential and greater visibility
- Reduce organizational risk and simplify the audit process
- Create user-centric, serverless apps that use Verified ID credentials.

Microsoft Entra Verified ID also provides 
[Face Check](~/verified-id/using-facecheck.md) as a premium feature available as an add-on. Premium features don't have a free tier.

There are two options to enable Face Check in your tenant: 

- Either start a Microsoft Entra Suite free trial, which includes eight Face Check verifications per user per month. Transactions after the eight included ones are charged at $0.25 USD per transaction. 
- Or enable the Face Check add-on for pay-as-you-go. Your organization is charged $0.25 USD for individual Face Check verifications performed
