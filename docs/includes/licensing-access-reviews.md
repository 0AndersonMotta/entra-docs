## Access reviews

You need a valid Azure AD Premium (P2) license for each person, other than Global administrators or User administrators, who will create or do access reviews. For more information, see [Access reviews license requirements](../governance/access-reviews-overview.md).

You might also need other Identity Governance features, such as [entitlement lifecycle management](../governance/entitlement-management-overview.md) or PIM. In that case, you might also need related licenses. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory pricing](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access-management/azure-ad-pricing).
