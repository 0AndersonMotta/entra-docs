# Initialize client applications using MSAL.js
This article describes initializing Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript (MSAL.js) with an instance of a user-agent application. The user-agent application is a form of public client application in which the client code is executed in a user-agent such as a web browser. These clients do not store secrets, since the browser context is openly accessible. To learn more about the client application types and application configuration options, read the [overview](msal-client-applications.md).

## Prerequisites
Before initializing an application, you first need to [register it with the Azure portal](scenario-spa-app-registration.md) so that your app can be integrated with the Microsoft identity platform. After registration, you may need the following information (which can be found in the Azure portal):

- The client ID (a string representing a GUID for your application)
- The identity provider URL (named the instance) and the sign-in audience for your application. These two parameters are collectively known as the authority.
- The tenant ID if you are writing a line-of-business application solely for your organization (also named single-tenant application).
- For web apps, you'll have to also set the redirectUri where the identity provider will return to your application with the security tokens.

## Initializing applications

You can use MSAL.js as follows in a plain JavaScript/Typescript application. Initialize MSAL authentication context by instantiating `UserAgentApplication` with a configuration object. The minimum required config to initialize MSAL.js is the clientID of your application which you should get from the application registration portal.

For authentication methods with redirect flows (`loginRedirect` and `acquireTokenRedirect`), in MSAL.js 1.2.x or earlier, you will need to explicitly register a callback for success or error through `handleRedirectCallback()` method. This is needed since redirect flows do not return promises as the methods with a pop-up experience do. This became optional in MSAL.js version 1.3.0.

```javascript
// Configuration object constructed
const config = {
    auth: {
        clientId: "abcd-ef12-gh34-ikkl-ashdjhlhsdg"
    }
}

// create UserAgentApplication instance
const myMSALObj = new UserAgentApplication(config);

function authCallback(error, response) {
    //handle redirect response
}

// (optional when using redirect methods) register redirect call back for Success or Error
myMSALObj.handleRedirectCallback(authCallback);
```

MSAL.js is designed to have a single instance and configuration of the `UserAgentApplication` to represent a single authentication context. Multiple instances are not recommended as they cause conflicting cache entries and behavior in the browser.

## Configuration options

MSAL.js has a configuration object shown below that provides a grouping of configurable options available for creating an instance of `UserAgentApplication`.

```javascript
type storage = "localStorage" | "sessionStorage";

// Protocol Support
export type AuthOptions = {
    clientId: string;
    authority?: string;
    validateAuthority?: boolean;
    knownAuthorities?: Array<string>;
    redirectUri?: string | (() => string);
    postLogoutRedirectUri?: string | (() => string);
    navigateToLoginRequestUrl?: boolean;
};

// Cache Support
export type CacheOptions = {
    cacheLocation?: CacheLocation;
    storeAuthStateInCookie?: boolean;
};

// Telemetry support
export type TelemetryOptions = {
    applicationName: string;
    applicationVersion: string;
    telemetryEmitter: TelemetryEmitter
};

// Library-specific support
export type SystemOptions = {
    logger?: Logger;
    loadFrameTimeout?: number;
    tokenRenewalOffsetSeconds?: number;
    navigateFrameWait?: number;
    telemetry?: TelemetryOptions
};

// Developer app/framework-specific environment support
export type FrameworkOptions = {
    isAngular?: boolean;
    unprotectedResources?: Array<string>;
    protectedResourceMap?: Map<string, Array<string>>;
};

// Configuration Object
export type Configuration = {
    auth: AuthOptions,
    cache?: CacheOptions,
    system?: SystemOptions,
    framework?: FrameworkOptions
};
```

Below is the full set of configurable options currently supported in the config object.

| AuthOptions | Required | Description |
| ----------- | :------: | :---------- |
| `clientId` | Required | The **Application (client) ID** of your application. Find this value on the application registration's overview page in **App registrations** in the Azure portal.
| `authority` | Optional | A URL specifying the endpoint from which MSAL requests security tokens. Default: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common`<p/>In **Azure AD**, `authority` is in the form `https://<instance>/<audience>`. `<instance>` is the identity provider domain (for example, `https://login.microsoftonline.com`) and `<audience>` is an identifier representing the sign-in audience. `audience` can be one of the following:<p/><li>`https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>` - Sign in users of a specific organization (single-tenant). `tenant` is a domain associated with tenant, like `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`, or the tenant's **Directory (tenant) ID** (a GUID).</li><li>`https://login.microsoftonline.com/common` - Sign in users with work and school accounts or a Microsoft personal account (MSA).</li><li>`https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations/` - Sign in users with work and school accounts.</li><li>`https://login.microsoftonline.com/consumers/` - Sign in users with personal Microsoft accounts (MSA) *only*.</li><br/>In **Azure AD B2C**, `authority` is in the form `https://<instance>/tfp/<tenant>/<policyName>/`. `<instance>` is `tenant-name.b2clogin.com`, `<tenant>` is `tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com` (or the tenant ID GUID), and `policyName` is the name of the B2C user flow or custom policy (for example, `B2C_1_signupsignin1`).
| `validateAuthority` | Optional |
| `knownAuthorities` | Optional |
| `redirectUri` | Optional |
| `postLogoutRedirectUri` | Optional |
| `navigateToLoginRequestUrl` | Optional |
