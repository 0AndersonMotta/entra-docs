# Tutorial: Sign in users and call the Microsoft Graph API from a JavaScript single-page application (SPA)

In this tutorial, you'll build a JavaScript single-page application (SPA) that signs in users and calls Microsoft Graph by using the implicit flow. The SPA you build uses the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) v1.x for JavaScript v1.0.

In this tutorial:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a JavaScript project with `npm`
> * Register the application in the Azure portal
> * Add code to support user sign-in and sign-out
> * Add code to call Microsoft Graph API
> * Test the app

>[!NOTE]
> We recommend all new applications to use [MSAL.js 2.x and the authorization code flow with PKCE and CORS](tutorial-v2-javascript-auth-code.md) support. This tutorial uses MSAL.js v1.x which is limited to using the implicit grant flow for single-page applications. 

At the end of this tutorial, you'll have created the folder structure below, and create the `.js` and `.html` files by copying the code blocks in the upcoming sections.

![a text depiction of the intended SPA folder structure](./media/tutorial-v2-javascript-spa/single-page-application-folder-structure.png)

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for running a local web server.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or other editor for modifying project files.
* A modern web browser. **Internet Explorer** is **not supported** by the app you build in this tutorial due to the app's use of [ES6](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) conventions.

## How the sample app generated by this guide works

![Shows how the sample app generated by this tutorial works](media/active-directory-develop-guidedsetup-javascriptspa-introduction/javascriptspa-intro.svg)

The sample application created by this guide enables a JavaScript SPA to query the Microsoft Graph API. This can also work for a web API that is set up to accept tokens from the Microsoft identity platform. The following steps outline how this works.
1. The user signs into the Microsoft identity platform.
1. The identity platform requests an *ID token* to authenticate the user.
1. After the sign-in step, the SPA acquires an *access token*, which will be used to gain access to the external API, **MS Graph**.
1. The *access token* is generated by the identity platform for use by the SPA to access the **MS Graph API**.
1. This *access token* is added to the HTTP requests through the authorization header, and acquires the user's profile and mails.
1. This data acquired by the *access token* are then called by the SPA.

Token acquisition and renewal are handled by the [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for JavaScript](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js).

## Set up your web server or project

> Prefer to download this sample's project instead? [Download the project files](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-graphapi-v2/archive/quickstart.zip).
>
> To configure the code sample before you execute it, skip to the [configuration step](#register-your-application).

## Create your project

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, and then create a folder to host your application. Here, we can call this folder `sampleApp`. There, we'll implement an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) web server to serve your `index.html` file.

1. Using a terminal (such as Visual Studio Code integrated terminal), locate your project folder, move into it, then type:

```console
npm init
```

2. You'll be presented with a series of prompts to create your app. Notice that the folder, `sampleApp` is now all lowercase. The items in brackets `()` are generated by default. Feel free to experiment, however for the purposes of this tutorial, you don't need to enter anything, and can press `Enter` to continue.
    
    ```console
    package name: (sampleapp)
    version: (1.0.0)
    description:
    entry point: (index.js)
    test command:
    git repository:
    keywords:
    author:
    license: (ISC)
    ```

3. Assuming nothing was entered in the previous step, the list will be as shown below, along with a consent prompt. If you're happy, you can press `Enter` and it will be written to a file called `package.json`.
    
    ```console
    {
      "name": "sampleapp",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "",
      "main": "index.js",
      "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
      },
      "author": "",
      "license": "ISC"
    }
    
    
    Is this OK? (yes)
    ```

4. Next, we need install the required dependencies. Express.js is a Node.js module designed to simplify the creation of web servers and APIs. Morgan is used to log HTTP requests and errors.

   ```console
   npm install express --save
   npm install morgan --save
   ```

5. Now, create a .js file in your current folder named `server.js`, and add the following code:

   ```JavaScript
   const express = require('express');
   const morgan = require('morgan');
   const path = require('path');

   //initialize express.
   const app = express();

   // Initialize variables.
   const port = 3000; // process.env.PORT || 3000;

   // Configure morgan module to log all requests.
   app.use(morgan('dev'));

   // Set the front-end folder to serve public assets.
   app.use(express.static('JavaScriptSPA'))

   app.get('*', function (req, res) {
       res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname + '/JavaScriptSPA/index.html'));
   });

   // Start the server.
   app.listen(port);
   console.log('Listening on port ' + port + '...');
   ```

You now have a server to serve your SPA. At this point, your folder structure should look like this.

**FIX ME with proper picture**

```console
- sampleApp
    - node_modules/
    - package-lock.json
    - package.json
    - server.js
```

In the next steps we'll create a new folder for the JavaScript SPA, and set up the user interface (UI).

> [!TIP]
> When you set up an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account, you create a tenant. This is a digital representation of your organization, and is primarily associated with a domain, like Microsoft.com. If you wish to learn how applications can work with multiple tenants, please refer to [**Multi-tenant apps**](./application-model.md/#multi-tenant-apps).

## Create the SPA UI

1. Create a new folder, `JavaScriptSPA` and then move into that folder. 

1. From there, create an `index.html` file for your JavaScript SPA. This file implements a UI built with [**Bootstrap 4 Framework**](https://www.javatpoint.com/bootstrap-4-layouts#:~:text=Bootstrap%204%20is%20the%20newest%20version%20of%20Bootstrap.,framework%20directed%20at%20responsive%2C%20mobile-first%20front-end%20web%20development.) and imports script files for configuration, authentication and API call.

   In the `index.html` file, add the following code:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, shrink-to-fit=no">

   > [!TIP]
   > You can replace the version of MSAL.js in the preceding script with the latest released version under [MSAL.js releases](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/releases).

2. Now, create a .js file named `ui.js`, which will access and update Document Object Model (DOM) elements, and add the following code:

   ```JavaScript
   // Select DOM elements to work with
   const welcomeDiv = document.getElementById("welcomeMessage");
   const signInButton = document.getElementById("signIn");
   const signOutButton = document.getElementById('signOut');
   const cardDiv = document.getElementById("card-div");
   const mailButton = document.getElementById("readMail");
   const profileButton = document.getElementById("seeProfile");
   const profileDiv = document.getElementById("profile-div");

   function showWelcomeMessage(account) {
     // Reconfiguring DOM elements
     cardDiv.classList.remove('d-none');
     welcomeDiv.innerHTML = `Welcome ${account.name}`;
     signInButton.classList.add('d-none');
     signOutButton.classList.remove('d-none');
   }

   function updateUI(data, endpoint) {
     console.log('Graph API responded at: ' + new Date().toString());

     if (endpoint === graphConfig.graphMeEndpoint) {
       const title = document.createElement('p');
       title.innerHTML = "<strong>Title: </strong>" + data.jobTitle;
       const email = document.createElement('p');
       email.innerHTML = "<strong>Mail: </strong>" + data.mail;
       const phone = document.createElement('p');
       phone.innerHTML = "<strong>Phone: </strong>" + data.businessPhones[0];
       const address = document.createElement('p');
       address.innerHTML = "<strong>Location: </strong>" + data.officeLocation;
       profileDiv.appendChild(title);
       profileDiv.appendChild(email);
       profileDiv.appendChild(phone);
       profileDiv.appendChild(address);

     } else if (endpoint === graphConfig.graphMailEndpoint) {
         if (data.value.length < 1) {
           alert("Your mailbox is empty!")
         } else {
           const tabList = document.getElementById("list-tab");
           tabList.innerHTML = ''; // clear tabList at each readMail call
           const tabContent = document.getElementById("nav-tabContent");

           data.value.map((d, i) => {
             // Keeping it simple
             if (i < 10) {
               const listItem = document.createElement("a");
               listItem.setAttribute("class", "list-group-item list-group-item-action")
               listItem.setAttribute("id", "list" + i + "list")
               listItem.setAttribute("data-toggle", "list")
               listItem.setAttribute("href", "#list" + i)
               listItem.setAttribute("role", "tab")
               listItem.setAttribute("aria-controls", i)
               listItem.innerHTML = d.subject;
               tabList.appendChild(listItem)

               const contentItem = document.createElement("div");
               contentItem.setAttribute("class", "tab-pane fade")
               contentItem.setAttribute("id", "list" + i)
               contentItem.setAttribute("role", "tabpanel")
               contentItem.setAttribute("aria-labelledby", "list" + i + "list")
               contentItem.innerHTML = "<strong> from: " + d.from.emailAddress.address + "</strong><br><br>" + d.bodyPreview + "...";
               tabContent.appendChild(contentItem);
             }
           });
         }
     }
   }
   ```

## Register your application

Before proceeding further with authentication, register your application on **Azure Active Directory**.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) using your Microsoft credentials.
1. Go to and select **Azure Active Directory**. If it isn't visible, you can find it by using the **Search** bar at the top of the screen.
1. Go to the left panel, and under **Manage**, select **App registrations** > **New registration**.
1. Enter a **Name** for your application, which can be changed later if you wish.
1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**.
1. In the **Redirect URI** section, select the **Web** platform from the drop-down list. For simplicity, we'll run this app on a local host, and you can type either of the following options:
    1. `http://localhost:3000/`
    1. If you're using a custom TCP port, use `http://localhost:<port>/` (where <port> is the custom TCP port number).
1. Select **Register**.
1. On the app **Overview** page, note the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**. We'll need both of them when we create the `authConfig.js` file.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Authentication**.
1. In the **Implicit grant and hybrid flows** section, select **ID tokens** and **Access tokens**. ID tokens and access tokens are required because this app must sign in users and call an API.
1. Select **Save**.

> [!TIP]
> A *redirect URI* (or *reply URL*) is the location where the authorization server sends the user once the app has been successfully authorized and granted an authorization code or access token. In this example we are using `http://localhost:3000/` as the *redirect URI*. The default `3000` value is the port we are using, which is set in the `server.js` file.
>
> You can set up a different redirect URI at any time. Say you wanted to use your own custom port instead of `3000`. From the home page in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/);
>
> 1. Select **Azure Active Directory**. 
> 2. Select the **Application Registration** pane on the left.
> 3. Select the app that you have created.
> 4. The **Overview** page should now be showing. Select the **Add a Redirect URI** text.
> 5. Under **Platform Configurations**, select **+ Add a platform**.
> 6. A new window will open on the right of your screen, and you can enter a redirect URI in the first box, e.g.
>     - `http://localhost:<port>/`* (where *\<port>* is the custom TCP port number).
> 7. Then select **Configure**. 

## Configure your JavaScript SPA

Create a new .js file named `authConfig.js` in your `JavaScriptSPA` folder. This code will contain your configuration parameters for authentication (*Client ID*, *Tenant ID*, *Redirect URI*), and add the following code:

```javascript
  const msalConfig = {
    auth: {
      clientId: "Enter_the_Application_Id_Here",
      authority: "Enter_the_Cloud_Instance_Id_Here/Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here",
      redirectUri: "Enter_the_Redirect_URI_Here",
    },
    cache: {
      cacheLocation: "sessionStorage", // This configures where your cache will be stored
      storeAuthStateInCookie: false, // Set this to "true" if you are having issues on IE11 or Edge
    }
  };

  // Add here scopes for id token to be used at MS Identity Platform endpoints.
  const loginRequest = {
    scopes: ["openid", "profile", "User.Read"]
  };

  // Add here scopes for access token to be used at MS Graph API endpoints.
  const tokenRequest = {
    scopes: ["Mail.Read"]
  };
```

Modify the values in the `msalConfig` section as described below. Most will be available in your app's **Overview** page on Azure:

- `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` is the **Application (client) ID** for the application you registered.
- `Enter_the_Cloud_Instance_Id_Here` is the instance of the Azure cloud. For the main or global Azure cloud, enter *https://login.microsoftonline.com*. For **national** clouds (for example, China), refer to [National clouds](./authentication-national-cloud.md).
- Set `Enter_the_Tenant_info_here` to one of the following options:
  - If your application supports *accounts in this organizational directory*, replace this value with the **Directory (tenant) ID** or **Tenant name** (for example, *contoso.microsoft.com*).
  - If your application supports *accounts in any organizational directory*, replace this value with **organizations**.
  - If your application supports *accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts*, replace this value with **common**. To restrict support to *personal Microsoft accounts only*, replace this value with **consumers**.
- `Enter_the_Redirect_URI_Here` is the default URL that you set in the previous section, `https://localhost:3000/`.


## Use the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to sign in the user

In the `JavaScriptSPA` folder, create a new .js file named `authPopup.js`, which will contain your authentication and token acquisition logic, and add the following code:

   ```JavaScript
   const myMSALObj = new Msal.UserAgentApplication(msalConfig);

   function signIn() {
     myMSALObj.loginPopup(loginRequest)
       .then(loginResponse => {
         console.log('id_token acquired at: ' + new Date().toString());
         console.log(loginResponse);

         if (myMSALObj.getAccount()) {
           showWelcomeMessage(myMSALObj.getAccount());
         }
       }).catch(error => {
         console.log(error);
       });
   }

   function signOut() {
     myMSALObj.logout();
   }

   function callMSGraph(theUrl, accessToken, callback) {
       var xmlHttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
       xmlHttp.onreadystatechange = function () {
           if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
              callback(JSON.parse(this.responseText));
           }
       }
       xmlHttp.open("GET", theUrl, true); // true for asynchronous
       xmlHttp.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + accessToken);
       xmlHttp.send();
   }

   function getTokenPopup(request) {
     return myMSALObj.acquireTokenSilent(request)
       .catch(error => {
         console.log(error);
         console.log("silent token acquisition fails. acquiring token using popup");

         // fallback to interaction when silent call fails
           return myMSALObj.acquireTokenPopup(request)
             .then(tokenResponse => {
               return tokenResponse;
             }).catch(error => {
               console.log(error);
             });
       });
   }

   function seeProfile() {
     if (myMSALObj.getAccount()) {
       getTokenPopup(loginRequest)
         .then(response => {
           callMSGraph(graphConfig.graphMeEndpoint, response.accessToken, updateUI);
           profileButton.classList.add('d-none');
           mailButton.classList.remove('d-none');
         }).catch(error => {
           console.log(error);
         });
     }
   }

   function readMail() {
     if (myMSALObj.getAccount()) {
       getTokenPopup(tokenRequest)
         .then(response => {
           callMSGraph(graphConfig.graphMailEndpoint, response.accessToken, updateUI);
         }).catch(error => {
           console.log(error);
         });
     }
   }
   ```

In summary, this code introduces methods of the application dealing with user access tokens, mostly done by the function `acquireTokenSilent`. For more information on the backend working of the application, head down to [More Information](#more-information).


## Calling the Microsoft Graph API using the token you just acquired

1. In the `JavaScriptSPA` folder create a .js file named `graphConfig.js`, which will store your Representational State Transfer ([REST](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/)) endpoints. Add the following code:

   ```JavaScript
      const graphConfig = {
        graphMeEndpoint: "Enter_the_Graph_Endpoint_Here/v1.0/me",
        graphMailEndpoint: "Enter_the_Graph_Endpoint_Here/v1.0/me/messages"
      };
   ```

   Where:
   - `Enter_the_Graph_Endpoint_Here` is the instance of MS Graph API. For the global MS Graph API endpoint, this can be replaced with `https://graph.microsoft.com`. For national cloud deployments, refer to [Graph API Documentation](/graph/deployments).

1. Next, create a .js file named `graph.js`, which will make a REST call to the Microsoft Graph API, and add the following code:

   ```javascript
   function callMSGraph(endpoint, token, callback) {
     const headers = new Headers();
     const bearer = `Bearer ${token}`;

     headers.append("Authorization", bearer);

## Test your code

Now that we have our all our code setup, we now need to test it!

1. We now need to configure the server to listen to a TCP port that's based on the location of your `index.html` file. For Node.js, we can start the web server to listen to the port we've specified in the previous section by running the following commands at a command-line prompt from the `JavaScriptSPA` folder:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

1. In your browser, enter `http://localhost:3000` (or `http://localhost:{port}` if you have chosen a custom port). You should see the contents of your `index.html` file and a **Sign In** button on the top right of the screen.


> [!Important]
> Be sure to enable popups and redirects for your site in your browser settings.

After the browser loads your `index.html` file, select **Sign In**. You'll now be prompted to sign in with the Microsoft identity platform:

### Provide consent for application access

The first time that you sign in to your application, you're prompted to grant it access to your profile and sign you in:

### View application results

After you sign in, your user profile information is returned in the Microsoft Graph API response that's displayed:

## Behind the scenes information

After a user selects the **Sign In** button for the first time, in the MSAL library, the `signIn` method calls `loginPopup` to sign in the user. This method opens a pop-up window with the *Microsoft identity platform endpoint* to prompt and validate the user's credentials. After a successful sign-in, the user is redirected back to the original `index.html` page. A token is received, processed by `msal.js`, and the information contained in the token is cached. This token is known as the *ID token* and contains basic information about the user, such as the user display name. If you plan to use any data provided by this token for any purposes, make sure this token is validated by your backend server to guarantee that the token was issued to a valid user for your application.

The SPA generated by this guide calls `acquireTokenSilent` and/or `acquireTokenPopup` to acquire an *access token* used to query the Microsoft Graph API for user profile info. If you need a sample that validates the ID token, take a look at [this](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-singlepageapp-dotnet-webapi-v2 "GitHub active-directory-javascript-singlepageapp-dotnet-webapi-v2 sample") sample application in GitHub. The sample uses an ASP.NET web API for token validation.

### Get a user token interactively

After the initial sign-in, you don't want to ask users to reauthenticate every time they need to request a token to access a resource. So *acquireTokenSilent* should be used most of the time to acquire tokens. There are situations, however, where you force users to interact with Microsoft identity platform. Examples include:

- Users need to reenter their credentials because the password has expired.
- Your application is requesting access to a resource, and you need the user's consent.
- Two-factor authentication is required.

Calling *acquireTokenPopup* opens a pop-up window (or *acquireTokenRedirect* redirects users to the Microsoft identity platform). In that window, users need to interact by confirming their credentials, giving consent to the required resource, or completing the two-factor authentication.

#### Get a user token silently

The `acquireTokenSilent` method handles token acquisition and renewal without any user interaction. After `loginPopup` (or `loginRedirect`) is executed for the first time, `acquireTokenSilent` is the method commonly used to obtain tokens used to access protected resources for subsequent calls. (Calls to request or renew tokens are made silently.)
`acquireTokenSilent` may fail in some cases. For example, the user's password may have expired. Your application can handle this exception in two ways:

1. Make a call to `acquireTokenPopup` immediately, which triggers a user sign-in prompt. This pattern is commonly used in online applications where there's no unauthenticated content in the application available to the user. The sample generated by this guided setup uses this pattern.

1. Applications can also make a visual indication to the user that an interactive sign-in is required, so the user can select the right time to sign in, or the application can retry `acquireTokenSilent` at a later time. This is commonly used when the user can use other functionality of the application without being disrupted. For example, there might be unauthenticated content available in the application. In this situation, the user can decide when they want to sign in to access the protected resource, or to refresh the outdated information.

> [!NOTE]
> This quickstart uses the `loginPopup` and `acquireTokenPopup` methods by default. If you are using Internet Explorer as your browser, it is recommended to use `loginRedirect` and `acquireTokenRedirect` methods, due to a [known issue](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/wiki/Known-issues-on-IE-and-Edge-Browser#issues) related to the way Internet Explorer handles pop-up windows. If you would like to see how to achieve the same result using `Redirect methods`, please [see](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-graphapi-v2/blob/quickstart/JavaScriptSPA/authRedirect.js).


### More information about making a REST call against a protected API

In the sample application created by this guide, the `callMSGraph()` method is used to make an HTTP `GET` request against a protected resource that requires a token. The request then returns the content to the caller. This method adds the acquired token in the *HTTP Authorization header*. For the sample application created by this guide, the resource is the Microsoft Graph API *me* endpoint, which displays the user's profile information.

### More information about scopes and delegated permissions

The Microsoft Graph API requires the *user.read* scope to read a user's profile. By default, this scope is automatically added in every application that's registered on the registration portal. Other APIs for Microsoft Graph, and custom APIs for your back-end server, might require more scopes. For example, the Microsoft Graph API requires the `Mail.Read` scope in order to list the user’s mails.

> [!NOTE]
> The user might be prompted for additional consents as you increase the number of scopes.
