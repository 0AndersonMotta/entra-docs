# Support and help options for developers 

If you need help or support for development-related questions, use one of the options below:

## 1. Search

If you have a development related question, you may be able to find the answer you need on our documentation, our [github samples](https://github.com/azure-samples), or [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com).

Type your problem or scenario on the following search box for a scoped search on Stack Overflow, our docs.microsoft.com, and our code samples:
<br/><br/>
<div>
<form method="get" class="clearFilter" action="http://www.bing.com/search" target="_blank">
<input aria-label="Bing scoped search" type="search" placeholder="Bing scoped search" name="q" size="45" style="box-sizing: border-box;font-size: 0.87rem;height: 36px;line-height: 1.8; padding: 0 10px;">
<a title="Clear Filter" class="clearInput" href="#"><span class="visually-hidden">Clear Filter</span></a>
<input type="submit" value="Search" />
<input type="hidden" name="q1" value="(site:stackoverflow.com OR site:docs.microsoft.com OR site:github.com/azure-samples OR site:cloudidentity.com)" /></td></tr>
</form>
</div>

## 2. Use our Development Support Tools

## 3. Post to Stack Overflow
[![Stack Overflow](media/active-directory-develop-get-help/stackoverflow-logo.png)](www.stackoverflow.com)

Stack Overflow is the preferred channel for development related questions - where both members of community as Microsoft team members are directly involved on helping you to solve your problem.

If you cannot find an answer to your problem with Search, submit a new question on Stack Overflow: use one of the following tags when making questions to help the community identify then answer your question on a timely manner:

|Component/Area  |Tags  |
|---------|---------|
|ADAL library |[[adal]](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/adal)|
|MSAL library     |[[msal]](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/msal)|

## 5. Open a support request

If you need to talk to someone, you can open a support request. If you are an Azure customer, there are several support options available. To compare plans, see [this page](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/). Developer support is also available for Azure customers. For information on how to purchase Developer support plans, see [this page](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/developer/).
