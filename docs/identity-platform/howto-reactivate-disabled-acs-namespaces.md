# How to: Reactivate disabled Access Control Service namespaces

On November 2017, we announced that Microsoft Azure Access Control Service (ACS), a service of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), is being retired on November 7, 2018.

Since then, we've sent multiple emails to ACS subscriptionsâ€™ admin email about the ACS retirement 12 months, 9 months, 6 months, 3 months, 1 month, 2 weeks, 1 week, and 1 day before the retirement date of 11/07/2018.

On October 3, 2018, we announced (through email and [a blog post](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/one-month-retirement-notice-access-control-service/)) an extension offer to customers who cannot finish their migration before 11/07/2018. The announcement also contained instructions for requesting the extension.

## Why your namespace is disabled

If you have not opted in for the extension, we will start to disable ACS namespace starting 11/07/2018. If you somehow missed all the communications and would still like to opt in for the extension to February 4th, 2019, you can still do with by following the instruction below.

## Find and enable your ACS namespaces

1. Download and install ACS PowerShell:
    1. Go to the PowerShell Gallery and download [Acs.Namespaces](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Acs.Namespaces/1.0.2).
    1. Install the module by running

        ```powershell
        Install-Module -Name Acs.Namespaces
        ```

    1. Get a list of all possible commands by running

        ```powershell
        Get-Command -Module Acs.Namespaces
        ```

        To get help on a specific command, run:

        ```
        Get-Help [Command-Name] -Full
        ```
    
        where `[Command-Name]` is the name of the ACS command.
1. List your available Azure subscriptions using the **Get-AcsSubscription** cmdlet.
1. List your ACS namespaces using the **Get-AcsNamespace** cmdlet.
1. Enable your ACs namespace(s) using the **Enable-AcsNamespace** cmdlet.

    Once you've enabled your namespace(s), you can request an extension so that the namespace(s) will not be disabled again before February 4, 2019. After that date, all request to ACS will fail.

## Request an extension

1. Navigate to your ACS namespace's management portal by going to https://{your-namespace}.accesscontrol.windows.net.
1. Select the **Read Terms** button to read the updated Terms of Use, which will direct you to a page with the updated Terms of Use.

1. Select **Request Extension** on the banner at the top of the page. The button will only be enabled after you read the updated Terms of Use.

    ![Select the Request Extension button](./media/howto-reactivate-disabled-acs-namespaces/request-extension-button.png)

1. After the extension request has been registered, the page will refresh with a new banner at the top of the page.
