# Daemon app that calls web APIs - code configuration

Learn how to configure the code for your daemon application that calls web APIs.

## MSAL Libraries supporting daemon apps

The Microsoft libraries supporting daemon apps are:

  MSAL library | Description
  ------------ | ----------
  ![MSAL.NET](media/sample-v2-code/logo_NET.png) <br/> MSAL.NET  | Supported platforms to build a daemon application are .NET Framework and .NET Core platforms (not UWP, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Android as those platforms are used to build public client applications)
  ![Python](media/sample-v2-code/logo_python.png) <br/> MSAL.Python | Development in progress - in public preview
  ![Java](media/sample-v2-code/logo_java.png) <br/> MSAL.Java | Development in progress - in public preview

## Configuration of the Authority

Given that the daemon applications don't use delegated permissions, but application permissions, their *supported account type* can't be *Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts (for example, Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com)*. Indeed, there's no tenant admin to grant consent to the daemon application for Microsoft personal accounts. You'll need to choose *accounts in my organization* or *accounts in any organization*.

Therefore the authority specified in the application configuration should be tenant-ed (specifying a Tenant ID or a domain name associated with your organization).

If you're an ISV and want to provide a multi-tenant tool, you can use `organizations`. But keep in mind that you'll also need to explain to your customers how to grant admin consent. See [Requesting consent for an entire tenant](v2-permissions-and-consent.md#requesting-consent-for-an-entire-tenant) for details. Also there's currently a limitation in MSAL: `organizations` is only allowed when the client credentials are an application secret (not a certificate). See [MSAL.NET bug #891](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/issues/891)

## Application configuration and instantiation

In MSAL libraries, the client credentials (secret or certificate) are passed as a parameter of the confidential client application construction.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Even if your application is a console application running as a service, if it's a daemon application it needs to be a confidential client application.

### Configuration file

The configuration file defines:
- the authority or instance and tenantId
- the ClientID that you got from the application registration
- either a client secret, or a certificate

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

[appsettings.json](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2/blob/master/1-Call-MSGraph/daemon-console/appsettings.json) from the [.NET Core console daemon](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2) sample.

```JSon
{
  "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{0}",
  "Tenant": "[Enter here the tenantID or domain name for your Azure AD tenant]",
  "ClientId": "[Enter here the ClientId for your application]",
  "ClientSecret": "[Enter here a client secret for your application]",
  "CertificateName": "[Or instead of client secret: Enter here the name of a certificate (from the user cert store) as registered with your application]"
}
```

> ![NOTE]
> Either you provide a clientSecret or a certificateName. Both settings are exclusive.

# [Python](#tab/python)

When building a confidential client with client secrets, the configuration file would be like this extract from the [confidential_client_secret_sample.py](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python/blob/dev/sample/confidential_client_secret_sample.py) sample in GitHub.

```JSon
{
    "authority": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations",
    "client_id": "your_client_id",
    "scope": ["https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"],
    "secret": "The secret generated by AAD during your confidential app registration"
}
```

When building a confidential client with certificates, it will be like this extract from the [confidential_client_certificate_sample.py](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python/blob/dev/sample/confidential_client_certificate_sample.py) sample in GitHub.

```JSon
{
    "authority": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations",
    "client_id": "your_client_id",
    "scope": ["https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"],
    "thumbprint": "790E... The thumbprint generated by AAD when you upload your public cert",
    "private_key_file": "filename.pem"
}
```

# [Java](#tab/java)

Here is the class used in msal4j dev samples to configure the samples: [TestData](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java/blob/dev/src/samples/public-client/TestData.java).

```Java
public class TestData {

    final static String TENANT_SPECIFIC_AUTHORITY = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TenantId>/";

    final static String PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID = "";

    final static String GRAPH_DEFAULT_SCOPE = "https://graph.windows.net/.default";
    final static String CONFIDENTIAL_CLIENT_ID = "";
    final static String CONFIDENTIAL_CLIENT_SECRET = "";
}
```

> ![NOTE]
> Either you provide a CONFIDENTIAL_CLIENT_ID or a CONFIDENTIAL_CLIENT_SECRET. Both settings are exclusive.
---

### Instantiation of the MSAL application

To instantiate the MSAL application, you need to:

- add, reference, or import the MSAL package (depending on the language)
- Then the construction is different depending on if you're using client secrets or certificates (or, as an advanced scenario, signed assertions)

The daemon application will be presented by an `IConfidentialClientApplication`

#### Reference the package

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

Add the [Microsoft.IdentityClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Client) NuGet package to your application.

Use MSAL.NET namespace in the source code

```CSharp
using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
```
In MSAL.NET, the confidential client application is represented by the `IConfidentialClientApplication` interface.

```CSharp
IConfidentialClientApplication app;
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
import msal
```

# [Java](#tab/java)

```java
import com.microsoft.aad.msal4j.*;

import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import java.util.function.BiConsumer;
import java.util.function.BiFunction;
```

---

#### Instantiate the confidential client application With client secrets

Here is the code to instantiate the confidential client application with a client secret:

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

```CSharp
app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(config.ClientId)
           .WithClientSecret(config.ClientSecret)
           .WithAuthority(new Uri(config.Authority))
           .Build();
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```Python
config = json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))

# Create a preferably long-lived app instance which maintains a token cache.
app = msal.ConfidentialClientApplication(
    config["client_id"], authority=config["authority"],
    client_credential={"thumbprint": config["thumbprint"], "private_key": open(config['private_key_file']).read()},
    # token_cache=...  # Default cache is in memory only.
                       # You can learn how to use SerializableTokenCache from
                       # https://msal-python.rtfd.io/en/latest/#msal.SerializableTokenCache
    )
```

# [Java](#tab/java)

```Java
ConfidentialClientApplication app = ConfidentialClientApplication.builder(
        TestData.CONFIDENTIAL_CLIENT_ID,
        ClientCredentialFactory.create(TestData.CONFIDENTIAL_CLIENT_SECRET))
        .authority(TestData.TENANT_SPECIFIC_AUTHORITY)
        .build();
```

---

#### Instantiate the confidential client application With client certificate

Here is the code to build an application with a certificate:

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

```CSharp
X509Certificate2 certificate = ReadCertificate(config.CertificateName);
app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(config.ClientId)
    .WithCertificate(certificate)
    .WithAuthority(new Uri(config.Authority))
    .Build();
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```Python
config = json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))

# Create a preferably long-lived app instance which maintains a token cache.
app = msal.ConfidentialClientApplication(
    config["client_id"], authority=config["authority"],
    client_credential={"thumbprint": config["thumbprint"], "private_key": open(config['private_key_file']).read()},
    # token_cache=...  # Default cache is in memory only.
                       # You can learn how to use SerializableTokenCache from
                       # https://msal-python.rtfd.io/en/latest/#msal.SerializableTokenCache
    )
```

# [Java](#tab/java)

In MSAL.Java there are two builders to instantiate the confidential client application with certificates:

```Java

InputStream pkcs12Certificate = ... ; /* containing PCKS12 formatted certificate*/
string certificatePassword = ... ;    /* contains the password to access the certificate */

ConfidentialClientApplication app = ConfidentialClientApplication.builder(
        TestData.CONFIDENTIAL_CLIENT_ID,
        ClientCredentialFactory.create(pkcs12Certificate, certificatePassword))
        .authority(TestData.TENANT_SPECIFIC_AUTHORITY)
        .build();
```

or

```Java
PrivateKey key = getPrivateKey(); /* RSA private key to sign the assertion */
X509Certificate publicCertificate = getPublicCertificate(); /* x509 public certificate used as a thumbprint */

ConfidentialClientApplication app = ConfidentialClientApplication.builder(
        TestData.CONFIDENTIAL_CLIENT_ID,
        ClientCredentialFactory.create(rsaPrivateKey, publicKeyCertificate))
        .authority(TestData.TENANT_SPECIFIC_AUTHORITY)
        .build();
```

---

#### Advanced scenario - instantiate the confidential client application With client assertions

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

Instead of a client secret or a certificate, the confidential client application can also prove its identity using client assertions
This advanced scenario is detailed in [Client assertions](msal-net-client-assertions.md)

# [Python](#tab/python)

MSAL python is in public preview. Signed assertions aren't yet supported

# [Java](#tab/java)

msal4j is in public preview. Signed assertions aren't yet supported
