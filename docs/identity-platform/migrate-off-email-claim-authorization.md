# Migrating Away from Incorrect Use of Email Claims for Authorization

This article is meant to provide guidance to developers whose applications are currently using an incorrect pattern where [unverified emails are used for authorization](). 

## Migrating applications to more secure configurations

Microsoft recommends **never** using mutable claims (such as email, preferred_username, etc) as identifiers to perform authorization checks or index users in a database. These values are re-usable and could expose your application to privilege escalation attacks. 

If your application is currently using a mutable value for indexing users, we recommend migrating to a globally unique identifier, such as the object ID (referred to as `oid` in the token claims). Doing so will ensure that each user is indexed on a value that cannot be re-used (or abused to impersonate another user). 


If your application uses email (or any other mutable claim) for authorization purposes, it is recommended to read through [Microsoft Identity platformâ€™s best practices for securing applications through validation of claims](./claims-validation) and implement the appropriate checks. 

## Short-term risk mitigation

To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access before updating application code, Microsoft Identity platform is introducing an additional property for the optional email claim, referred to as `replace_unverified_email_with_upn`, which will replace (or remove) email claims, depending on account type, according to the table below: 

| **User type** | **Replaced with** |
|---------------|-------------------|
| On Premise | Home tenant UPN |
| Cloud Managed | Home tenant UPN |
| Microsoft Account (MSA) | Email address user signed up with |
| Email OTP | Email address user signed up with |
| Social IDP: Google | Email address user signed up with | 
| Social IDP: Facebook | Email claim will not be issued |
| Direct Fed | Email claim will not be issued |

Enabling `replace_unverified_email_with_upn` eliminates the most significant risk of cross-tenant privilege by ensuring authorization does not occur against an arbitrarily set email value.  It should be noted that while enabling this property prevents unauthorized access, it can also break access to users with unverified emails. Internal data suggests the overall percentage of users with unverified emails is low and this tradeoff is appropriate to secure applications in the short term. 

The `replace_unverified_email_with_upn` option is also documented under the documentation for [additional properties of optional claims](./active-directory-optional-claims.md#additional-properties-of-optional-claims).

Microsoft views enabling `replace_unverified_email_with_upn` mainly as a short-term risk mitigation strategy while migrating applications away from email claims, and **not as a permanent solution** for resolving account escalation risk related to email usage.
