# How to: Get a complete list of apps using ADAL in your tenant

Support for Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) will end on June 30, 2022. Apps using ADAL on existing OS versions will continue to work, but technical support and security updates will end. Without continued security updates, apps using ADAL will become increasingly vulnerable to the latest security attack patterns. This article provides guidance on how to use Azure Monitor workbooks to obtain a list of all apps that use ADAL in your tenant.

## Sign-ins workbook

Workbooks are a set of queries that collect and visualize information that is available in Azure AD logs. [Learn more about the sign-in logs schema here](../reports-monitoring/reference-azure-monitor-sign-ins-log-schema.md). The Sign-ins workbook in the Azure AD admin portal now has a new table to assist you in determining which applications use ADAL and how often they are used. First, we’ll detail how to access the workbook before showing the visualization for the list of applications.

## Prerequisites

To use workbook feature, you need to:

-  [Integrate your Azure AD sign-ins and audit logs with Azure Monitor](../reports-monitoring/howto-integrate-activity-logs-with-log-analytics.md)


## 1. Access the sign-ins workbook

Once you've integrated your Azure AD sign-ins and audit logs with Azure Monitor as specified in the prerequisites, follow the steps below to access the sign-ins workbook:

   1. Sign into the Azure portal 
   1. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Monitoring** > **Workbooks** 
   1. In the Usage section, open the **Sign-ins** workbook

## 2. Identify apps using ADAL for authentication

The Sign-ins workbook has a new table at the bottom of the page that can show you which recently used apps are using ADAL as shown below. You can also export a list of the apps. Update these apps to use MSAL.

If there are no apps using ADAL, the workbook will display a view as shown below.

## 3. Update your code

After identifying your apps that use ADAL, you can migrate them to MSAL depending on your application type as illustrated below.
