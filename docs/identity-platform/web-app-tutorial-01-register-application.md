# Tutorial: Register an application

To enable an application to use authentication with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), it must be registered in a tenant. Registering an application establishes a trust relationship between the application and the Microsoft identity platform. The trust is unidirectional: the application trusts the Microsoft identity platform, and not the other way around.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> * Specify the account types that can be used with the application
> * Register the application and record its identifiers

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account that has an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* The Azure account must have permission to manage applications in Azure AD. Use the least privileged of the following Azure AD role that you need to register the application:
  * Application administrator
  * Application developer
  * Cloud application administrator
* Completion of the [Set up a tenant quickstart](quickstart-create-new-tenant.md).

## Register the application

### Locate the tenant in Azure AD

Organizations may have more than one Azure AD tenant. Choose the tenant where the application should be registered.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory**.
1. Use the **Directories + subscriptions** filter in the top menu to switch to the tenant where the application should be registered.

1. Once your tenant is selected, you can close the page by clicking the 'X' icon on the top right, which will bring you to your tenant's **Overview** page.

### Start registration and enter a name for the application

Provide a name for the application. The name is seen by users in the various portals.

1. Under **Manage**, select **App registrations > New registration**.
1. Enter a **Name** for the application, such as *NewWebApp1*.

### Select the account type and register the application

Specify the type of accounts that the application supports and then register the application.

1. Accept the selection of **Accounts in this organizational directory only (Contoso only - Single tenant)** for the **Supported account type**.
1. Select **Register**.

### Record the identifiers for the application

In the following tutorials, the **Directory (tenant) ID** and the **Application (client) ID** are needed to complete the configuration of the application.

1. Locate the **Directory (tenant) ID** and the **Application (client) ID** on the **Overview** page of the application.
1. Record the values that you located to be used in later steps.
