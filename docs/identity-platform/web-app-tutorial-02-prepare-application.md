# Tutorial: Prepare an application for authentication

This tutorial demonstrates how to create an ASP.NET Core project in a supported integrated development environment. You will create and upload a self-signed certificate and configure the application for authentication.

In this tutorial:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an ASP.NET Core project
> * Create a self-signed certificate
> * Configure the settings for the application
> * Define platform settings
> * Define the URLs needed for the application

## Prerequisites

* Completion of the prerequisites and steps in [Tutorial: Register an application](web-app-tutorial-01-register-application.md).
* Although any integrated development environment (IDE) that supports .NET applications can be used, the following IDEs are used for this tutorial. They can be downloaded from the [Downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads) page.
    - Visual Studio 2022
    - Visual Studio Code
    - Visual Studio 2022 for Mac
* Some steps in this tutorial use the .NET CLI. For more information about this tool, see [dotnet command](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet).

## Create an ASP.NET Core project

After registering an application on the Azure portal, a .NET web application needs to be created using an IDE. Use the tabs below to create an ASP.NET Core project with your IDE.

### [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

This tutorial uses the **ASP.NET Core Web App** template in Visual Studio 2022. Additions are made to show what needs to be added to an application for authentication.

1. Open Visual Studio, and then select **Create a new project**.
1. Search for and choose the **ASP.NET Core Web App** template, and then select **Next**.
1. Enter a name for the project, such as *NewWebAppLocal*.
1. Choose a location for the project or accept the default option, and then select **Next**.
1. Accept the default for the **Framework**, **Authentication type**, and **Configure for HTTPS**.

> [!NOTE]
> On this page of the application configuration, the **Authentication type** could be changed to `Microsoft identity platform`, which would add the authentication configuration to the application. This tutorial is meant to provide an understanding of the code and configuration for authentication, so the setting is kept at **None**.

6. Select **Create**.

### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

1. Open Visual Studio Code, and select the **Open Folder...** option. Navigate to and select the location you wish to create your project.
1. Open a new terminal by selecting **Terminal** in the top bar, then **New Terminal**.
1. Create a new folder using either the terminal or the **New Folder...** icon at the top of the left panel. Provide a similar name to the one registered on the Azure portal, for example, *NewWebAppLocal*.
1. Using the terminal, run the following commands to change into the folder directory and create the project;
1. Run the following command in the terminal:

```powershell
cd NewWebAppLocal
dotnet new webapp --framework net6.0
```

### [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/visual-studio-for-mac)

1. Open Visual Studio, and then select **New**.
1. Under **Web and Console** in the left navigation bar, select **App**.
1. Under **ASP.NET Core**, select **APP** and ensure **C#** is selected in the drop down menu, then select **Continue**.
1. Accept the default for the **Target Framework and Advanced**, then select **Continue**.
1. Enter a name for **Project name**, this will be reflected in **Solution Name**. Provide a similar name to the one registered on the Azure portal, such as *NewWebAppLocal*.
1. Accept the default location for the project or choose a different location, and then select **Create**.

## Create and upload a self-signed certificate

The use of certificates is suggested for securing the application. When using certificates, make sure to manage and monitor them appropriately. This tutorial uses a simple self-signed certificate for development purposes, certificates issued by a certificate authority should be used for production.

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnetcli)

1. In Visual Studio, select **Tools > Command Line > Developer Command Prompt**.
1. Enter the following command to clear the HTTPS development certificates from the machine:

    ```powershell
    dotnet dev-certs https --clean
    ```

1. Enter the following command to create a new self-signed certificate:

    ```powershell
    dotnet dev-certs https -ep ./certificate.crt --trust
    ```

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

1. In the PowerShell command window, run the following commands replacing the `{certificateName}` value with the name of the certificate.

    ```powershell
    $certname = "{certificateName}"    ## Replace {certificateName}
    $cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject "CN=$certname" -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" -KeyExportPolicy Exportable -KeySpec Signature -KeyLength 2048 -KeyAlgorithm RSA -HashAlgorithm SHA256
    ```

2. Run the following command to export the certificate to be uploaded to the Azure portal. Replace `{projectLocation}` with the location of the application project:

    ```powershell
    Export-Certificate -Cert $cert -FilePath "C:\{projectLocation}\$certname.cer"
    ```

### Upload certificate to the portal

To make the certificate available to the application, it must be uploaded into the tenant.

1. Starting from the **Overview** page of the app created earlier, under **Manage**, select **Certificates & secrets** and select the **Certificates (0)** tab.
1. Select **Upload certificate**.

1. Browse for and select the certificate that was previously created.
1. Enter a description for the certificate.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Double-click the thumbprint, select the vertical ellipsis, and then select **Copy** to record the thumbprint for the certificate to be used later.

## Configure the application for authentication

Now that the certificate is uploaded, the application needs to be configured for authentication.

1. Open the *appsettings.json* file and add the following configuration settings:
  
    ``` json
    {
    "AzureAd": {
      "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
      "TenantId": "Enter the tenant ID here",
      "ClientId": "Enter the client ID here",
      "ClientCertificates": [
        {
          "SourceType": "StoreWithThumbprint",
          "CertificateStorePath": "CurrentUser/My",
          "CertificateThumbprint": "Enter the certificate thumbprint here"
        }    
      ],
      "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc"
    },
    }
    ```

    * `Instance` - The endpoint of the cloud provider. Check with the different available endpoints in [National clouds](authentication-national-cloud.md#azure-ad-authentication-endpoints).
    * `TenantId` - The identifier of the tenant where the application is registered. Replace the text in quotes with the **Directory (tenant) ID** value that was recorded earlier from the overview page of the registered application.
    * `ClientId` - The identifier of the application, also referred to as the client. Replace the text in quotes with the **Application (client) ID** value that was recorded earlier from the overview page of the registered application.
    * `ClientCertificates` - A self-signed certificate is used for authentication in the application. Replace the text of the `CertificateThumbprint` with the thumbprint of the certificate that was previously recorded.
    * `CallbackPath` - Is an identifier to help the server redirect a response to the appropriate application. This value shouldnâ€™t be changed.
1. Save changes to the file.
1. Record the value of the `CallbackPath`. This will be used later to define the **Redirect URI** on the Azure portal.
1. Under **Properties**, open the *launchSettings.json* file.
1. Record the https URL listed in the value of `applicationURL`, for example `https://localhost:7100` This will also be used when defining the **Redirect URI**.


## Define the platform

1. In the Azure portal, under **Manage**, select **App registrations**, and then select the application that was previously created.
1. In the left menu, under **Manage**, select **Authentication**.
1. In **Platform configurations**, select **Add a platform**, and then select **Web**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/web-app-tutorial-02-prepare-application/select-platform-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot on how to select the platform for the application." lightbox="./media/web-app-tutorial-02-prepare-application/select-platform-expanded.png":::

## Define URLs

1. Under **Redirect URIs**, enter the **applicationURL** and the **CallbackPath** that was recorded when configuring the application. For example, `https://localhost:7100/signin-oidc`.
1. Under **Front-channel logout URL**, enter the application URL and a callback path for signing out. For example, `https://localhost:7100/signout-oidc`.
1. Under **Implicit grant and hybrid flows**, select **ID tokens**.
