# Microsoft identity platform token exchange scenarios with SAML and OAuth

SAML and OpenID Connect (OIDC) / OAuth are popular standards used to implement single sign-on. Some apps might only speak SAML and others might only speak OIDC/OAuth. Both standards use tokens to communicate secrets.

This article outlines common scenarios where you need to exchange tokens between standards. Basic guidance is provided including what is supported, what is not supported, and what is possible though not recommended.

## Scenario: You have a SAML token and want to call Graph using an OAuth token

Is this scenario supported? Basic guidance on how to do it? Should we cover using AD FS vs. AAD and also ADAL vs. MSAL? I put placeholder info below.

### AD FS (on premises based identity management) compared to Azure AD (cloud based identity management)


### ADAL vs MSAL
Using ADAL library (often called v1 of Microsoft's identity library) compared to using MSAL (often called v2 of Microsoft's identity library). For more information about ADAL versus MSAL, see [Overview of Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](msal-overview.md).

## Scenario: You have an OAuth token and you want to call into an app implemented with SAML

Is this scenario supported? Basic guidance on how to do it? Should we cover using AD FS vs. AAD and also ADAL vs. MSAL? I put placeholder info below.
