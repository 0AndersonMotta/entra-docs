# Support and help options for developers

If you're just starting to integrate with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Microsoft identities, or Microsoft Graph API, or when you're implementing a new feature to your application, there are times when you need to obtain help from the community or understand the support options that you have as a developer. Here are suggestions for where you can get help.

## Create an Azure support request

</div>

Explore the range of [Azure support options and choose the plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans) that best fits, whether you're a developer just starting your cloud journey or a large organization deploying business-critical, strategic applications. Azure customers can create and manage support requests in the Azure portal.

- [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview). If you already have an Azure Support Plan, [open a support request here](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest).

- If you are not an Azure customer, you can also open a support request with Microsoft via [our commercial support](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness).

- You can also try a [virtual agent](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus/?ws=support) to obtain support or ask questions.
