# web API that calls Web APIs - app registration

This page explains the app registration specifics for a web API that calls Web APIs.

A Web API calling downstream Web APIs has the same registration as a protected Web API. You'll therefore need to follow the instructions in [Protected Web API - app registration](scenario-protected-web-api-app-registration.md)

However since the Web App now calls Web APIs, it becomes a confidential client application. That's why there's a bit of extra registration required: it needs to share secrets (client credentials) with the Microsoft identity platform.

## API permissions

Web applications call APIs on behalf of the user for which the bearer token was received. They need to request delegated permissions. For details see [Add permissions to access web APIs](quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis.md#add-permissions-to-access-web-apis)
