In this quickstart, you download and run a code sample that demonstrates how a Python web application can sign in users and get an access token to call the Microsoft Graph API. Users with a personal Microsoft Account or an account in any Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) organization can sign into the application.

This diagram shows how the sample app works:

![Shows how the sample app generated by this quickstart works](../../media/quickstart-v2-python-webapp/python-quickstart.svg)


## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Python packages: [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), [Flask-Session2](https://pypi.org/project/flask-session2/), [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [identity](https://pypi.org/project/identity/)


## Step 1: Register your application

To register your application and add the app's registration information to your solution manually, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/" target="_blank">Azure portal</a>.
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Directory + subscription** filter :::image type="icon" source="../../media/common/portal-directory-subscription-filter.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to select the tenant in which you want to register an application.
1. Enter "app registrations" in the search bar at the top of the Azure portal and select **App registrations** in the results.
1. Select **New registration**.
1. Enter a **Name** for your application, for example `python-webapp` . Users of your app might see this name, and you can change it later.
1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**.
1. Under **Redirect URIs**, select **Web** for the platform.
1. Enter a redirect URI of `http://localhost:5000/getAToken`. You can change that later if needed.
1. Select **Register**.
1. On the app **Overview** page, note the **Application (client) ID** value for later use.
1. Under **Manage**, select the **Certificates & secrets** and from the **Client secrets** section, select **New client secret**.
1. Type a key description (for instance app secret), leave the default expiration, and select **Add**.
1. Note the **Value** of the **Client Secret** for later use.
1. Under **Manage**, select **API permissions** > **Add a permission**.
1. Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
1. From the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, select **Microsoft Graph**.
1. From the **Delegated permissions** section, ensure that the right permissions are checked: **User.ReadBasic.All**. Use the search box if necessary.
1. Select the **Add permissions** button.

## Step 2: Download the project

[Download the sample project](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-python-webapp/archive/master.zip) and extract the contents to a folder on your computer.

Optionally, if you use an integrated development environment, open the folder in your favorite IDE.

## Step 3: Configure the project

Go to the application folder.

Create an `.env` file in the root folder of the project using `.env.sample` as a guide.

```python
CLIENT_ID=<client id>
CLIENT_SECRET=<client secret>
TENANT_ID=<tenant id>
```

* Set the value of `CLIENT_ID` to the **Application (client) ID** for the registered application, available on the overview page.
* Set the value of `CLIENT_SECRET` to the client secret you created in **Certificates & Secrets** for the registered application.
* Set the value of `TENANT_NAME` to the **Directory (tenant) ID** of the registered application, available on the overview page.

Those environment variables are referenced in the `app_config.py` file, but they are kept in a separate `.env` file to
keep them out of source control. The provided `.gitignore` file will prevent the `.env` file from being checked in.

## Step 4: Run the code sample

1. Create a virtual environment for the app:

    [!INCLUDE [Virtual environment setup](<./includes/quickstart-python/virtual-environment-setup.md>)]

1. Install the requirements using pip:

    ```shell
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the app from the command line, specifying the host and port to match the redirect URI:

    ```shell
    python3 -m flask run --host=localhost --port=5000
    ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > This quickstart application uses a client secret to identify itself as confidential client. Because the client secret is added as a plain-text to your project files, for security reasons, it is recommended that you use a certificate instead of a client secret before considering the application as production application. For more information on how to use a certificate, see [these instructions](../../active-directory-certificate-credentials.md).
