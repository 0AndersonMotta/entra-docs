# Configure a user-assigned managed identity to trust an external identity provider (preview)

This article describes how to manage a federated identity credential.  The federated identity credential creates a trust relationship between a user-assigned managed identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and an external identity provider (IdP).  

After you configure your user-assigned managed identity to trust an external IdP, configure your external software workload to exchange a token from the external IdP for an access token from Microsoft identity platform. Using that access token, the external workload accesses Azure AD protected resources without needing to manage secrets (in supported scenarios).  To learn more about the token exchange workflow, read about [workload identity federation](workload-identity-federation.md).  

In this article, you learn how to create, list, and delete federated identity credentials on a user-assigned managed identity.

## Important considerations and limitations

When you configure a federated identity credential, there are several important pieces of information to provide.

*issuer* and *subject* are the key pieces of information needed to set up the trust relationship. *issuer* is the URL of the external identity provider and must match the `issuer` claim of the external token being exchanged.  *subject* is the identifier of the external software workload and must match the `sub` (`subject`) claim of the external token being exchanged. *subject* has no fixed format, as each IdP uses their own - sometimes a GUID, sometimes a colon delimited identifier, sometimes arbitrary strings. The combination of `issuer` and `subject` must be unique on the app.  When the external software workload requests Microsoft identity platform to exchange the external token for an access token, the *issuer* and *subject* values of the federated identity credential are checked against the `issuer` and `subject` claims provided in the external token. If that validation check passes, Microsoft identity platform issues an access token to the external software workload.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you accidentally add the incorrect external workload information in the *subject* setting the federated identity credential is created successfully without error.  The error does not become apparent until the token exchange fails.

*audiences* lists the audiences that can appear in the external token.  This field is mandatory, and defaults to "api://AzureADTokenExchange". It says what Microsoft identity platform must accept in the `aud` claim in the incoming token.  This value represents Azure AD in your external identity provider and has no fixed value across identity providers - you may need to create a new application registration in your IdP to serve as the audience of this token.

*name* is the unique identifier for the federated identity credential, which has a character limit of 120 characters and must be URL friendly. It is immutable once created.

*description* is the un-validated, user-provided description of the federated identity credential.

## Configure a federated identity credential on a user-assigned managed identity

Run the az rest command to create a new federated identity credential on your user-assigned managed identity (specified by the object ID of the app).  Specify the *name*, *issuer*, *subject*, and other parameters.

```azurecli
az login 

# set variables 
# in Linux shell remove $ from set variable statement 
$location="westcentralus" // this can be any supported location  
$subscription="{your subscription ID}" 
$rg="fic-test-rg" 

# user assigned identity name 
$uaId="fic-test-ua" 

# federated identity credential name 
$ficId="fic-test-fic-name"  

# create prerequisites if required.  
# otherwise make sure that existing resources names are set in variables above 
az account set --subscription $subscription 
az group create --name $rg --location $location --subscription $subscription 
az identity create --name $uaId --resource-group $rg --location $location --subscription $subscription  

# create/update federated identity credential

### Configure Azure PowerShell locally

To use Azure PowerShell locally for this article instead of using Cloud Shell:

1. Install [the latest version of Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps) if you haven't already.

1. Sign in to Azure.

    ```azurepowershell
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

1. Install the [latest version of PowerShellGet](/powershell/scripting/gallery/installing-psget#for-systems-with-powershell-50-or-newer-you-can-install-the-latest-powershellget).

    ```azurepowershell
    Install-Module -Name PowerShellGet -AllowPrerelease
    ```

    You might need to `Exit` out of the current PowerShell session after you run this command for the next step.

1. Install the prerelease version of the `Az.ManagedServiceIdentity` module to perform the user-assigned managed identity operations in this article.

    ```azurepowershell
    Install-Module -Name Az.ManagedServiceIdentity -AllowPrerelease
    ```

## Template creation and editing

Resource Manager templates help you deploy new or modified resources defined by an Azure resource group. Several options are available for template editing and deployment, both local and portal-based. You can:

- Use a [custom template from Azure Marketplace](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-portal.md#deploy-resources-from-custom-template) to create a template from scratch or base it on an existing common or [quickstart template](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/).
- Derive from an existing resource group by exporting a template. You can export them from either [the original deployment](../../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal.md#export-resource-groups-to-templates) or from the [current state of the deployment](../../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal.md#export-resource-groups-to-templates).
- Use a local [JSON editor (such as VS Code)](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/quickstart-create-templates-use-the-portal.md), and then upload and deploy by using PowerShell or the Azure CLI.
- Use the Visual Studio [Azure Resource Group project](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/create-visual-studio-deployment-project.md) to create and deploy a template. 

## Configure a federated identity credential on a user-assigned managed identity

Federated identity credential and parent user assigned identity can be created or updated be means of template below.  You can [deploy ARM templates](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/quickstart-create-templates-use-the-portal) from Azure Portal.

All of the template parameters are mandatory.

There is a limit of 3-120 symbols for a federated identity credential name length. It must be alphanumeric, dash, underscore. First symbol is alphanumeric only.  

You must add exactly 1 audience to a Federated Credential, this gets verified during token exchange. Please use “api://AzureADTokenExchange” as the default value.

List, Get, and Delete operations are not available with template. Please refer to Azure CLI for this.
