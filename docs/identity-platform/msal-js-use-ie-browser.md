# Known issues on Internet Explorer browsers (MSAL.js)

The Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript (MSAL.js) is generated for [JavaScript ES5](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#ECMAScript_Edition_5_.28ES5.29) so that it can run in Internet Explorer. There are, however, a few things to know.

## Run an app in Internet Explorer

If you intend to use MSAL.js in applications that can run in Internet Explorer, you'll need to add a reference to a promise polyfill before referencing the MSAL.js script.

```html
<script
  src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bluebird/3.3.4/bluebird.min.js"
  class="pre"
></script>
```

Internet Explorer doesn't support JavaScript promises natively.

## Debugging an application running in Internet Explorer

### Running in production

Deploying your application to production (for instance in Azure Web apps) normally works fine, provided the end user has accepted popups. We tested it with Internet Explorer 11.

### Running locally

If you want to run and debugÂ your application locally in Internet Explorer, be aware of the following considerations (assuming that you want to run your application at _http://localhost:1234_):

- Internet Explorer has a security mechanism named "protected mode", which prevents MSAL.js from working correctly. Among the symptoms, after you sign in, the page can be redirected to _http://localhost:1234/null_.

- To run and debug your application locally, you'll need to disable "protected mode". Follow these steps to disable "protected mode":

  1. Select Internet Explorer **Tools** (the gear icon).
  1. Select **Internet Options** and then the **Security** tab.
  1. Select **Internet** zone, and uncheck **Enable Protected Mode (requires restarting Internet Explorer)**. Internet Explorer warns that your computer is no longer protected. Select **OK**.
  1. Restart Internet Explorer.
  1. Run and debug your application.

When you're done, restore the Internet Explorer security settings. Select **Settings** -> **Internet Options** -> **Security** -> **Reset all zones to default level**.
