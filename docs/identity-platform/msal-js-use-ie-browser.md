# Known issues on Internet Explorer browsers (MSAL.js)

For better compatibility with Internet Explorer, we generate the Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript (MSAL.js) for [JavaScript ES5](https://262.ecma-international.org/5.1/), but there are other things to consider as you develop your application.

## Run an app in Internet Explorer

Internet Explorer lacks native support for JavaScript Promises, required by MSAL.js.

To support JavaScript Promises in an Internet Explorer app, reference a Promise polyfill before you reference MSAL.js.

## Debugging an application running in Internet Explorer

### Running in production

Deploying your application to production (for instance in Azure Web apps) normally works fine, provided the end user has accepted popups. We tested it with Internet Explorer 11.

### Running locally

If you want to run and debugÂ your application locally in Internet Explorer, be aware of the following considerations (assuming that you want to run your application at _http://localhost:1234_):

- Internet Explorer has a security mechanism named "protected mode", which prevents MSAL.js from working correctly. Among the symptoms, after you sign in, the page can be redirected to _http://localhost:1234/null_.

- To run and debug your application locally, you'll need to disable "protected mode". Follow these steps to disable "protected mode":

  1. In Internet Explorer, select **Tools** > **Internet Options** > **Security** tab > **Internet** zone.
  1. Clear the **Enable Protected Mode (requires restarting Internet Explorer)** checkbox.
  1. Select **OK** to restart Internet Explorer.

When you're done debugging, follow the previous steps and select (instead of clear) the **Enable Protected Mode (requires restarting Internet Explorer)** checkbox.
