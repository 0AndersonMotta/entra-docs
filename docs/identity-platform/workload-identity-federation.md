# Workload identity federation (preview)
This article provides an overview of workload identity federation for software workloads. Using workload identity federation allows you to access Azure and Microsoft Graph resources without needing to manage secrets. 

You can use workload identity federation with GitHub Actions or Kubernetes.

## Why use workload identity federation?

Typically, a software workload (such as an application, service, script, or container) needs an identity in order to authenticate and access resources or communicate with other services.  When these workloads run on Azure, developers can use managed identities and the Azure platform manages the credentials for those identities.  For a software workload running outside of Azure, developers use application credentials (a secret or certificate) to access Azure or Microsoft Graph resources.  These application credentials need to be managed by the developer, which introduces a maintenance burden and the risk of leaking secrets or having certificates expire.

Workload identity federation allows an Azure AD application to trust tokens from an external identity provider, such as GitHub, and exchange trusted tokens for access tokens from Microsoft identity platform.  Using that access token, the software workload can access Azure and Microsoft Graph resources to which the application has been granted access. This eliminates the maintenance burden of manually managing credentials and eliminates the risk of leaking secrets or having certificates expire. 

## How it works
Create a trust relationship between the external identity provider and Microsoft identity platform. This trust is created by configuring a federated identity credential on an application object in Azure AD, which can be done in the *Azure portal* or through *Microsoft Graph*.

While the scenarios differ, the method for exchanging a foreign token for an access token is the same. Letâ€™s look at an example where GitHub will be the foreign token issuer. GitHub issues a token to a GitHub Actions workflow. The Azure login action uses this token and requests Microsoft identity platform to exchange it for an access token. Microsoft identity platform validates the token issued by GitHub and checks that it is trusted by the Azure AD application for which a token is requested. When the checks are satisfied, Microsoft identity platform returns an access token to the workflow. The workflow can then perform specific actions against Azure, for example deploying an application from a GitHub repo to Azure Functions or Azure App Service.  

The following diagram shows the general workflow of a workload exchanging a foreign token for an access token and then accessing Azure resources.
