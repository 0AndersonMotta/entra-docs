#Customer intent: As an application developer, I want to learn how to use brokers with my Xamarin iOS or Android application and MSAL.NET.

# Use Microsoft Authenticator or Intune Company Portal on Xamarin applications

On Android and iOS, brokers like Microsoft Authenticator and the Android-specific Microsoft Intune Company Portal enable:

- **Single sign-on (SSO)**: Users don't need to sign in to each application.
- **Device identification**: The broker accesses the device certificate. This certificate is created on the device when it's joined to the workplace.
- **Application identification verification**: When an application calls the broker, it passes its redirect URL. The broker verifies the URL.

To enable one of these features, use the `WithBroker()` parameter when you call the `PublicClientApplicationBuilder.CreateApplication` method. The `.WithBroker()` parameter is set to true by default.

The setup of brokered authentication in the Microsoft Authentication Library for .NET (MSAL.NET) varies by platform:

* [iOS applications](#brokered-authentication-for-ios)
* [Android applications](#brokered-authentication-for-android)

## Brokered authentication for iOS

Use the following steps to enable your Xamarin.iOS app to communicate with the [Microsoft Authenticator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458) app. If you're targeting iOS 13, consider reading about [Apple's breaking API change](./msal-net-xamarin-ios-considerations.md).

### Step 1: Enable broker support

You must enable broker support for individual instances of `PublicClientApplication`. Support is disabled by default. When you create `PublicClientApplication` through `PublicClientApplicationBuilder`, use the `WithBroker()` parameter as the following example shows. The `WithBroker()` parameter is set to true by default.

```csharp
var app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder
                .Create(ClientId)
                .WithBroker()
                .WithReplyUri(redirectUriOnIos) // $"msauth.{Bundle.Id}://auth" (see step 6 below)
                .Build();
```

### Step 2: Enable keychain access

To enable keychain access, you must have a keychain access group for your application. You can use the `WithIosKeychainSecurityGroup()` API to set your keychain access group when you create your application:

```csharp
var builder = PublicClientApplicationBuilder
     .Create(ClientId)
     .WithIosKeychainSecurityGroup("com.microsoft.adalcache")
     .Build();
```

For more information, see [Enable keychain access](msal-net-xamarin-ios-considerations.md#enable-keychain-access).

### Step 3: Update AppDelegate to handle the callback

When MSAL.NET calls the broker, the broker calls back to your application through the `OpenUrl` method of the `AppDelegate` class. Because MSAL waits for the broker's response, your application needs to cooperate to call MSAL.NET back. To enable this cooperation, update the *AppDelegate.cs* file to override the following method.

```csharp
public override bool OpenUrl(UIApplication app, NSUrl url,
                             string sourceApplication,
                             NSObject annotation)
{
    if (AuthenticationContinuationHelper.IsBrokerResponse(sourceApplication))
    {
      AuthenticationContinuationHelper.SetBrokerContinuationEventArgs(url);
      return true;
    }

    else if (!AuthenticationContinuationHelper.SetAuthenticationContinuationEventArgs(url))
    {
         return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

This method is invoked every time the application is started. It's used as an opportunity to process the response from the broker and complete the authentication process that MSAL.NET started.

### Step 4: Set UIViewController()

Still in the *AppDelegate.cs* file, you need to set an object window. You don't typically need to set the object window for Xamarin iOS, but you do need an object window to send and receive responses from the broker.

To set up the object window:

1. In the *AppDelegate.cs* file, set `App.RootViewController` to a new `UIViewController()`. This assignment ensures that the call to the broker includes `UIViewController`. If this setting is assigned incorrectly, you might get this error:

      `"uiviewcontroller_required_for_ios_broker":"UIViewController is null, so MSAL.NET cannot invoke the iOS broker. See https://aka.ms/msal-net-ios-broker"`

1. On the `AcquireTokenInteractive` call, use `.WithParentActivityOrWindow(App.RootViewController)` and then pass in the reference to the object window you'll use.

    In *App.cs*:

    ```csharp
       public static object RootViewController { get; set; }
    ```

    In *AppDelegate.cs*:

    ```csharp
       LoadApplication(new App());
       App.RootViewController = new UIViewController();
    ```

    In the `AcquireToken` call:

    ```csharp
    result = await app.AcquireTokenInteractive(scopes)
                 .WithParentActivityOrWindow(App.RootViewController)
                 .ExecuteAsync();
    ```

### Step 5: Register a URL scheme

MSAL.NET uses URLs to invoke the broker and then return the broker response to your app. To complete the round trip, register a URL scheme for your app in the *Info.plist* file.

The `CFBundleURLSchemes` name must include `msauth.` as a prefix. Follow the prefix with `CFBundleURLName`.

In the URL scheme, `BundleId` uniquely identifies the app: `$"msauth.(BundleId)"`. So if `BundleId` is `com.yourcompany.xforms`, then the URL scheme is `msauth.com.yourcompany.xforms`.

> [!NOTE]
> This URL scheme becomes part of the redirect URI that uniquely identifies your app when it receives the response from the broker.

```XML
 <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
    <array>
      <dict>
        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
        <string>Editor</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
        <string>com.yourcompany.xforms</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
          <string>msauth.com.yourcompany.xforms</string>
        </array>
      </dict>
    </array>
```

### Step 6: Add the broker identifier to the LSApplicationQueriesSchemes section

MSAL uses `â€“canOpenURL:` to check whether the broker is installed on the device. In iOS 9, Apple locked down the schemes that an application can query for.

Add `msauthv2` to the `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` section of the *Info.plist* file, as in the following example:

```XML
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>msauthv2</string>
      <string>msauthv3</string>
    </array>
```

### Step 7: Register your redirect URI in the application portal

When you use the broker, your redirect URI has an extra requirement. The redirect URI _must_ have the following format:

```csharp
$"msauth.{BundleId}://auth"
```

Here's an example:

```csharp
public static string redirectUriOnIos = "msauth.com.yourcompany.XForms://auth";
```

Notice that the redirect URI matches the `CFBundleURLSchemes` name that you included in the *Info.plist* file.

### Step 8: Make sure the redirect URI is registered with your app

The redirect URI needs to be added to your app's registration in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). To make it easier, you can use **App registrations** in the Azure portal to generate the brokered redirect URI from the bundle ID.

To generate the redirect URI:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations** > your registered app
1. Select **Authentication** > **Add a platform** > **iOS / macOS**
1. Enter your bundle ID, and then select **Configure**. In the pane that's displayed, the generated redirect URI appears in the **Redirect URI** text box.
1. Select **Done** to complete the addition of the redirect URI.

## Brokered authentication for Android

### Step 1: Enable broker support

Broker support is enabled on a per-`PublicClientApplication` basis. It's disabled by default. Use the `WithBroker()` parameter (set to true by default) when creating the `IPublicClientApplication` through the `PublicClientApplicationBuilder`.

```CSharp
var app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder
                .Create(ClientId)
                .WithBroker()
                .WithRedirectUri(redirectUriOnAndroid) // See step #4
                .Build();
```

### Step 2: Update AppDelegate to handle the callback

When MSAL.NET calls the broker, the broker will, in turn, call back to your application with the `OnActivityResult()` method. Since MSAL will wait for the response from the broker, your application needs to route the result to MSAL.NET.

Route the result to the `SetAuthenticationContinuationEventArgs(int requestCode, Result resultCode, Intent data)` method by overriding the `OnActivityResult()` method as shown here:

```CSharp
protected override void OnActivityResult(int requestCode, Result resultCode, Intent data)
{
   base.OnActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
   AuthenticationContinuationHelper.SetAuthenticationContinuationEventArgs(requestCode, resultCode, data);
}
```

This method is invoked every time the broker application is launched, and is used as an opportunity to process the response from the broker and complete the authentication process started by MSAL.NET.

### Step 3: Set an Activity

> [!WARNING]
> TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO

For brokered authentication to work you'll need to set an activity so that MSAL can send and receive the response from broker.

To do this, you'll need to provide the activity(usually the MainActivity) to the `WithParentActivityOrWindow(object parent)` as the parent object.

**For example:**

In the Acquire Token call:

```CSharp
result = await app.AcquireTokenInteractive(scopes)
             .WithParentActivityOrWindow((Activity)context))
             .ExecuteAsync();
```

### Step 4: Register your RedirectUri in the application portal

MSAL uses URLs to invoke the broker and then return back to your app. To complete that round trip, you need to register a URL scheme for your app. This Redirect URI needs to be registered on the Azure AD app registration portal as a valid redirect URI for your application.


The redirect URI needed for your application is dependent on the certificate used to sign the APK.

```
Example: msauth://com.microsoft.xforms.testApp/hgbUYHVBYUTvuvT&Y6tr554365466=
```

The last part of the URI, `hgbUYHVBYUTvuvT&Y6tr554365466=`, is the signature that the APK is signed with, base64 encoded.
However, during the development phase of your application using Visual Studio, if you're debugging your code without signing the apk with a specific certificate, Visual Studio will sign the apk for you for debugging purposes, giving the APK a unique signature for the machine that it's built on. Thus, each time you build your app on a different machine, you'll need to update the redirect URI in the application's code and the application's registration in the Azure portal in order to authenticate with MSAL.

While debugging, you may encounter an MSAL exception (or log message) stating the redirect URI provided is incorrect. **This exception will also provide you with the redirect URI that you should be using** with the current machine you are debugging on. You can use this redirect URI to continue developing for the time being.

Once you are ready to finalize your code, be sure to update the redirect URI in the code and on the application's registration in the Azure portal to use the signature of the certificate you will be signing the APK with.

In practice, this means that you have to register a redirect URI for each member of the team, plus a redirect URI for the production signed version of the APK.

You can also compute this signature yourself, similar to how MSAL does it:

```CSharp
   private string GetRedirectUriForBroker()
   {
      string packageName = Application.Context.PackageName;
      string signatureDigest = this.GetCurrentSignatureForPackage(packageName);
      if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(signatureDigest))
      {
            return string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, "{0}://{1}/{2}", RedirectUriScheme,
               packageName.ToLowerInvariant(), signatureDigest);
      }

      return string.Empty;
   }

   private string GetCurrentSignatureForPackage(string packageName)
   {
            PackageInfo info = Application.Context.PackageManager.GetPackageInfo(packageName,
               PackageInfoFlags.Signatures);
            if (info != null && info.Signatures != null && info.Signatures.Count > 0)
            {
               // First available signature. Applications can be signed with multiple signatures.
               // The order of Signatures is not guaranteed.
               Signature signature = info.Signatures[0];
               MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.GetInstance("SHA");
               md.Update(signature.ToByteArray());
               return Convert.ToBase64String(md.Digest(), Base64FormattingOptions.None);
               // Server side needs to register all other tags. ADAL will
               // send one of them.
            }
   }
```

You also have the option of acquiring the signature for your package by using the keytool with the following commands:

For Windows: `keytool.exe -list -v -keystore "%LocalAppData%\Xamarin\Mono for Android\debug.keystore" -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android`

For Mac: `keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64`

### Step Five (optional): Fall-back to the system browser

If MSAL is configured to use the broker, but the broker is not installed, MSAL will fall back to using a web view (a browser). MSAL will try to authenticate using the default system browser in the device. This will fail out of the box because the redirect URI is configured for broker and the system browser does not know how to use it to navigate back to MSAL. To resolve this, you can configure what's know as an intent filter with the broker redirect URI that you used in step four. You will need to modify your application's manifest to add the intent filter as shown below.

```xml
//NOTE: the slash before your signature value added to the path attribute
//This uses the base64 encoded signature produced above.
<intent-filter>
      <data android:scheme="msauth"
                    android:host="Package Name"
                    android:path="/Package Signature"/>
```

for example, if you have a redirect URI of `msauth://com.microsoft.xforms.testApp/hgbUYHVBYUTvuvT&Y6tr554365466=` your manifest should look something like

```xml
//NOTE: the slash before your signature value added to the path attribute
//This uses the base64 encoded signature produced above.
<intent-filter>
      <data android:scheme="msauth"
                    android:host="com.microsoft.xforms.testApp"
                    android:path="/hgbUYHVBYUTvuvT&Y6tr554365466="/>
```
**Please be sure to add a / in front of the signature in the "android:path" value**

As an alternative, you can configure MSAL to fallback to the embedded browser, which does not rely on a redirect URI:

```csharp
.WithUseEmbeddedWebUi(true)
```

## Troubleshooting tips for Android brokered authentication

It can be a bit challenging to get the brokered authentication scenario to work properly so here are some tips on avoiding issues

 - Make sure to register your redirect URI in your application's registration in the Azure [Portal](https://portal.azure.com/). This is a very common issue that developers run into.

- Make sure you have installed the minimum required version of either **Intune Company Portal** [Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.windowsintune.companyportal) (Version 5.0.4689.0 or greater) or **Microsoft Authenticator** [Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator) (Version 6.2001.0140 or greater). Either of these two apps can be used for brokered authentication on Android.

- If you have installed both applications on your device, The default broker that MSAL will communicate with will be the first broker installed on the device. This means if you install Microsoft Authenticator first and then Intune Company Portal afterwards, brokered authentication will only happen on the Microsoft Authenticator.

- If you run into issues with brokered authentication and you need more information to diagnose and resolve your issue, you have the ability to view the broker's logs which may be able to help. To view the broker logs on the Microsoft Authenticator, follow the steps below:

    1. Press the menu button on the top right corner of the app.
    1. Press "Help"
    1. Press "Send Logs"
    1. Press "View Logs"
    1. Press "Copy All" at the bottom
    1. At this point you should have the broker logs copied to the device's clipboard. The best way to debug with these logs is to email them to yourself and view them on a computer. This will make it much easier to digest the logs as opposed to looking at them on the device directly. You can also use a test editor on android to save the logs as a text file and use a USB cable to copy the file to a computer.

 - For Intune Company Portal you can follow the steps below

    1. Press the menu button on the top left corner of the app.
    1. Press "Settings"
    1. Scroll down to "Diagnostic Data" and press "Copy Logs". This will copy the broker logs to a file on SD Card that you can access with a USB cable on a conputer

Once you have the logs you can search through them for your authentication attempts via correlation id. The correlation id is attached to every authentication request and each phase of the authentication attempts will have the correlation id attached to it. To find errors returned from the AAD authentication endpoint, you can look for "AADSTS".
