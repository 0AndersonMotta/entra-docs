# Daemon app - app registration specifics

This page explains the app registration specifics for a daemon application

## Supported account types

Given that daemon applications only make sense in Azure AD tenant, when you create the application you will need to choose:

- either **Accounts in this organizational directory only**. This choice is the most common case, as daemon applications are usually written by line-of-business (LOB) developers.
- or **Accounts in any organizational directory**. You'll make this choice if you're an ISV providing a utility tool to your customers. You'll need customer's tenants admins to approve it.

## Authentication - No Reply URI needed

In the case where your confidential client application uses **only** the client credentials flow, the reply URL doesn't need to be registered. It's not needed either for the application configuration/construction. The client credentials flow doesn't use it.

## API Permissions - app permissions and admin consent

A daemon application can only request application permissions to APIs (not delegated permissions). In the **API Permission** page for the application registration, after you've selected **Add a permission** and chosen the API family, choose **Application permissions**, and then select your permissions

![App permissions and admin consent](media/scenario-daemon-app/app-permissions-and-admin-consent.png)

Daemon applications require have a tenant admin pre-consent to the application calling the Web API. This consent is provided in the same **API Permission** page, by a tenant admin selecting **Grant admin consent to *our organization***

If you're an ISV building a multi-tenant application, you'd want to check the [Deployment - case of multi-tenant daemon apps](scenario-daemon-production#deployment---case-of-multi-tenant-daemon-apps) paragraph.

## Registration of secrets or certificates

Like for any confidential client application, you need to register a secret or certificate. You can register your application secrets either through the interactive experience in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredAppsPreview), or using command-line tools (like PowerShell)

### Registering client secrets using the application registration portal

The management of client credentials happens in the **certificates & secrets** page for an application:

![image](media/quickstart-update-azure-ad-app-preview/credentials-certificates-secrets-expanded.png)

- the application secret (also named client secret) is generated by Azure AD, during the registration of the confidential client application. This generation happens when you select **New client secret**. At that point, you must copy the secret string in the clipboard for use in your app, before selecting **Save**. This string won't be presented any longer.
- the certificate is uploaded in the application registration using the **Upload certificate** button

For details, see [Quickstart: Configure a client application to access web APIs | Add credentials to your application](quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis.md#add-credentials-to-your-web-application)

### Registering client secrets using PowerShell

Alternatively, you can register your application with Azure AD using command-line tools. The [active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2) sample shows how to register an application secret or a certificate with an Azure AD application:

- For details on how to register an application secret, see [AppCreationScripts/Configure.ps1](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2/blob/5199032b352a912e7cc0fce143f81664ba1a8c26/AppCreationScripts/Configure.ps1#L190)
- For details on how to register a certificate with the application, see [AppCreationScripts-withCert/Configure.ps1](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2/blob/5199032b352a912e7cc0fce143f81664ba1a8c26/AppCreationScripts-withCert/Configure.ps1#L162-L178)
