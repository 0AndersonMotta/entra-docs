# Move a daemon application to production

## Deployment - case of multi-tenant daemon apps

If you are an ISV creating a daemon application that can run in several tenants, you will need to make sure that the tenant admins:

- provisions a service principal for the application
- grants consent to the application

You'll need to explain to your customers how to perform these operations. See [Requesting consent for an entire tenant](v2-permissions-and-consent.md#requesting-consent-for-an-entire-tenant) for details.

## Next steps

Here are a few links to learn more:

### .NET

- If you have not already, try the quickstart:
  - [Acquire a token and call Microsoft Graph API from a console app using app's identity](./quickstart-v2-netcore-daemon.md)
- Reference documentation for:
  - Instantiating [ConfidentialClientApplication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.appconfig.confidentialclientapplicationbuilder?view=azure-dotnet)
  - Calling [AcquireTokenForClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.apiconfig.acquiretokenforclientparameterbuilder?view=azure-dotnet)
- Other samples / tutorials:
  - [microsoft-identity-platform-console-daemon](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/microsoft-identity-platform-console-daemon) features a simple .NET Core daemon console application that displays the users of a tenant querying the Microsoft Graph.

    The same sample also illustrates the variation with certificates.

  - [microsoft-identity-platform-aspnet-webapp-daemon](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/microsoft-identity-platform-aspnet-webapp-daemon) features an ASP.NET MVC web application that sync's data from the Microsoft Graph using the identity of the application, instead of on behalf of a user. Also illustrates the admin consent process.
