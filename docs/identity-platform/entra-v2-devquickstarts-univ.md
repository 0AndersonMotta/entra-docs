# Add sign-in to a Windows Universal app using the v2.0 endpoint

See the [Universal Windows Platform application signing in users with Microsoft and calling the Microsoft Graph](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-uwp-v2) code sample in GitHub showing a Windows Universal Platform client application using MSAL.NET, to access the Microsoft Graph for a user authenticating with Azure AD V2 endpoint.

This sample is a variation of the [Call the Microsoft Graph API from a Windows Desktop app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/guidedsetups/active-directory-windesktop) tutorial, which explains the concepts step by step.
