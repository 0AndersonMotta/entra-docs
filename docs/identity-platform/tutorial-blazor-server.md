# Tutorial: Create a Blazor Server app that uses the Microsoft identity platform for authentication

Blazor Server provides support for hosting Razor components on the server in an ASP.NET Core app. This tutorial will show you how to implement authentication and retrieve data from Microsoft Graph for a Blazor Server app with the Microsoft identity platform. 

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Set up a new Blazor Server app configured to use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for authentication
> * Handle both authentication and authorization using Microsoft.Identity.Web 
> * Retrieve data from Microsoft Graph

## Prerequisites
- [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
- An Azure AD tenant where you can register an app. If you don’t have access to an Azure AD tenant, you can get one by registering to the [Microsoft 365 Developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) or by creating a [Free Azure Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) account
- (Optional) [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

## Option 1: Create the app using the .NET CLI and register it in the Azure portal

Every app that uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for authentication must be registered with Azure AD. You can create a new registration and then use the [.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/) to create a new Blazor app using the following instructions. If you are using Visual Studio 2019, you can skip this step and complete step two. 

First, follow the instructions in [Register an application in the Azure portal](quickstart-register-app.md) with the following settings:

- For **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
- Leave the **Redirect URI** drop down set to **Web** and provide the following redirect URI: `https://localhost:{PORT}/signin-oidc`. The default port for an app running on Kestrel is 5001. If the app is run on a different Kestrel port, use the app's port. For IIS Express, the randomly generated port for the app can be found in the app's properties in the **Debug** panel. Since the app doesn't exist at this point and the IIS Express port isn't known, you can update the redirect URI after the app is created and you have the port number. 
- Disable the **Permissions** > **Grant admin consent to openid and offline_access permissions** check box.


Once the app is registered, note the following information:

* Application (client) ID (for example, `41451fa7-82d9-4673-8fa5-69eff5a761fd`)
* Directory (tenant) ID (for example, `e86c78e2-8bb4-4c41-aefd-918e0565a45e`)

In **Authentication** > **Platform configurations** > **Web**:

1. Confirm the **Redirect URI** of `https://localhost:{PORT}/signin-oidc` is present.
1. For **Implicit grant**, select the check boxes for **Access tokens** and **ID tokens**.
1. The remaining defaults for the app are acceptable for this experience.
1. Select the **Save** button.

Create the app in an empty folder. Replace the placeholders in the following command with the information recorded earlier and execute the command in a command shell:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new blazorserver -au SingleOrg --client-id "{CLIENT ID}" -o {APP NAME} --tenant-id "{TENANT ID}"
```

| Placeholder   | Azure portal name       | Example                                |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `{APP NAME}`  | &mdash;                 | `BlazorSample`                         |
| `{CLIENT ID}` | Application (client) ID | `41451fa7-82d9-4673-8fa5-69eff5a761fd` |
| `{TENANT ID}` | Directory (tenant) ID   | `e86c78e2-8bb4-4c41-aefd-918e0565a45e` |

The output location specified with the `-o|--output` option creates a project folder if it doesn't exist and becomes part of the app's name.

> [!NOTE]
> If the port wasn't configured earlier with the app's known port, return to the app's registration in the Azure portal and update the redirect URI with the correct port.

You can now run the app and log in using an Azure AD user account. You can skip option two and move on to simplifying the code with Microsoft.Identity.Web.

## Option 2: Register and create the app using Visual Studio 2019

You can use Visual Studio's built in templates to create a Blazor server app. Skip this step if you have already completed step one. To do so:

1. Create a new project. Search for a Blazor template, and select the Blazor Server options from the results. Select **Next**.
2. Give your project a name and confirm the save location. Select **Create**. 
2. Choose **Blazor Server App** and select **Change** under **Authentication** type from **No authentication** to **Work or School Accounts**. 
3. Select **Create**. 

You now have a working app sample that will sign users in using the Microsoft identity platform. 

Try running the app. The first time it runs, you will see a screen that prompts you to provide consent for this app to access your directory information. This is part of the Microsoft identity platforms [permissions and consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent) process which is necessary for the app to have permission to retrieve data from the directory on behalf of the user. 

![Picture of dialog box asking the user for permission for the app to sign the user in and read their profile](./media/tutorial-blazor-server/consent-dialog-1.png)

The Visual Studio creation tool automatically registered this application in your tenant. Applications that authenticate users always need to be registered with the identity provider they use. You can verify that this registration happened successfully by going to the Azure portal, navigating to Azure Active Directory, and viewing your registered apps. The TenantID and ClientID found there will match the settings defined in your *appsettings.json* file. 

![Screenshot of the completed app. The webpage says "Hello, world! Welcome to your new app." There is a menu bar on the side with buttons for "home", "counter", and "fetch data".](./media/tutorial-blazor-server/final-app-1.png)

## Simplify the code by using Microft.Identity.Web

The apps created in the steps above utilize [ASP .NET Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/identity/overview/getting-started/introduction-to-aspnet-identity) for authentication. You will need to add some more code that queries the [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](./msal-overview.md)  endpoint in order to get authorization for your users to access protected APIs. In other words, **authentication** and **authorization** are done separately and require more code. 

However, you can use the [Microsoft.Identity.Web](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web) authentication and token management library to handle both. **Microsoft.Identity.Web** is meant to abstract away the complexities and allow you to quickly implement authentication and authorization, as shown here. You can use the following instructions to update your code and make use of Microsoft.Identity.Web.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft.Identity.Web is currently in preview.

First, download the following NuGet packages to have access to the libraries:
-	Microsoft.Identity.Web (0.2.2 preview)
-	Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI (0.2.2 preview)

If using .NET CLI, you can find instructions for downloading the packages on [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Web](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Web).

Or you can use Visual Studio: 

![Screenshot of Visual Studio's package browser, with the Microsoft.Identity.Web package highlighted.](./media/tutorial-blazor-server/nuget-package-1.png)

![Screenshot of Visual Studio's package browser, with the Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI package highlighted.](./media/tutorial-blazor-server/nuget-package-2.png)

Next, perform a couple small code changes to swap out the old authentication code and plug-in the new code.

Open *Startup.cs* and replace the following code 

```csharp
services.AddAuthentication(AzureADDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddAzureAD(options => Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options));

services.AddControllersWithViews(options =>
{
    var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
        .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
        .Build();
    options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
});
```

With

```csharp
services.AddMicrosoftWebAppAuthentication(Configuration);
services.AddControllersWithViews(options =>
{
   var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
        .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
        .Build();
        options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
        }).AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();
```

Then, ensure that your app can use the right v2 endpoints for signin and signout. Open the LoginDisplay.razor and update the code as per below:

```html
<AuthorizeView>
    <Authorized>
        Hello, @context.User.Identity.Name!
        <a href="MicrosoftIdentity/Account/SignOut">Log out</a>
    </Authorized>
    <NotAuthorized>
        <a href="MicrosoftIdentity/Account/SignIn">Log in</a>
    </NotAuthorized>
</AuthorizeView>
```

You will notice that there are no dedicated pages for sign-in and sign out. Instead, they are built into the Microsoft.Identity.Web library. So as long as you update the Area to be “MicrosoftIdentity”, no other change is needed.

As you can see, with a couple of lines of code, you are able to leverage the Microsoft.Identity.Web library to authenticate against Azure AD and take advantage of easy authentication and authorization with MSAL. 

## Retrieving data from Microsoft Graph

[Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/overview) offers a wide range of APIs to allow you to build rich and immersive apps with the Microsoft 365 data your users own. Using the Microsoft identity platform as the identity provider for your app enables you to access this information easily by accessing protected Graph APIs using the authentication and authorization tokens you get from the Microsoft identity platform. In this section, you learn how to do this.

Before you start, make sure to log out of your app, because you will be making changes to the required permissions and your current token will not work. 

In the following steps, you pull user's emails and display them within the app. To achieve this, you first need to extend the app registration permissions in Azure AD to add access to the email data and then you need to add some code in our Blazor app to retrieve and display this data in one of our pages: 

1. In the Azure portal search for and select **Azure Active Directory**. 
2. Under **Manage**, select **App registrations** and select your new app. 
3. Go to **API Permissions**. 
4. Select Add New Permission and then select **Microsoft Graph**. 
5. Select **Delegated Permissions** and select the “Mail.Read” permission. 

You also need to create a User Secret since our app will need a way to validate the token and retrieve the data without any user interaction: 

1. Within the same app registration, open the **Certificates & secrets** tab. 
2. Create a new secret that never expires
3. Copy the **Value** to your clipboard. You can’t access it again once you navigate away from this tab/page. However, you can always recreate it as needed.

Navigate back to your Blazor app. Add the client secret in *appsettings.json*. Inside the AzureAD config section, add the following line:

```yaml
“ClientSecret”: “<your secret>”
```

In the *Startup.cs* class, you need to update your code to ensure that it fetches the appropriate token with the right permissions and stores it in a cache so that you can use it later when you make the call to Microsoft Graph. You will also add **HttpClient** to the services pipeline to efficiently make HTTP calls to Microsoft Graph later. Add the following to the end of the **ConfigureServices** method.

 ```csharp
services.AddMicrosoftWebAppAuthentication(Configuration)
    .AddMicrosoftWebAppCallsWebApi(Configuration, new string[] { "User.Read", "Mail.Read" })
    .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();
           
services.AddHttpClient();
```

Next, you need to update the code in the *FetchData.razor* page to retrieve our email data instead of the default (random) weather details. Replace the code in that file with the following:

```csharp
@page "/fetchdata"

@inject IHttpClientFactory HttpClientFactory
@inject Microsoft.Identity.Web.ITokenAcquisition TokenAcquisitionService

<h1>Weather forecast</h1>

<p>This component demonstrates fetching data from a service.</p>

@if (messages == null)
{
    <p><em>Loading...</em></p>
}
else
{
    <h1>Hello @userDisplayName !!!!</h1>
    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Subject</th>
                <th>Sender</th>
                <th>Received Time</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            @foreach (var mail in messages)
            {
                <tr>
                    <td>@mail.Subject</td>
                    <td>@mail.Sender</td>
                    <td>@mail.ReceivedTime</td>
                </tr>
            }
        </tbody>
    </table>
}

@code {

    private string userDisplayName;
    private List<MailMessage> messages = new List<MailMessage>();

    private HttpClient _httpClient;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        _httpClient = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient();


        // get a token
        var token = await TokenAcquisitionService.GetAccessTokenForUserAsync(new string[] { "User.Read", "Mail.Read" });

        // make API call
        _httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new System.Net.Http.Headers.AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", token);
        var dataRequest = await _httpClient.GetAsync("https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me");

        if (dataRequest.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            var userData = System.Text.Json.JsonDocument.Parse(await dataRequest.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync());
            userDisplayName = userData.RootElement.GetProperty("displayName").GetString();
        }

        var mailRequest = await _httpClient.GetAsync("https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/messages?$select=subject,receivedDateTime,sender&$top=10");

        if (mailRequest.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            var mailData = System.Text.Json.JsonDocument.Parse(await mailRequest.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync());
            var messagesArray = mailData.RootElement.GetProperty("value").EnumerateArray();

            foreach (var m in messagesArray)
            {
                var message = new MailMessage();
                message.Subject = m.GetProperty("subject").GetString();
                message.Sender = m.GetProperty("sender").GetProperty("emailAddress").GetProperty("address").GetString();
                message.ReceivedTime = m.GetProperty("receivedDateTime").GetDateTime();
                messages.Add(message);
            }
        }
    }

    public class MailMessage
    {
        public string Subject;
        public string Sender;
        public DateTime ReceivedTime;
    }
}

```

> [!NOTE]
> If you stop the app while using an in-memory token cache, the token cache will be cleared but the application cookie may persist. To solve this, you can use a persistent token cache, or clear you cookies from the browser session to avoid an abnormal app state. 

Let’s launch our app and ensure that you are logged out first as the current token won’t have the right permissions and you’ve changed quite a few things in our code. You’ll notice that the next time you log in, you are prompted for the newly added permissions which means that everything is working as expected. Now, beyond basic user profile data, the app is requesting access to our email data. 

![Image of a dialog box asking the user permission for the Blazor app to maintain access to data you have given it access to, sign you in and read your profile, and read your mail.](./media/tutorial-blazor-server/consent-dialog-2.png)

After granting consent you can navigate to the “Fetch Data” page to read some emails!

![Screenshot of the final app. The webpage is titled "Weather forecast". It has a heading that says "Hello Christos Matskas" and it shows a list of emails belonging to Christos.](./media/tutorial-blazor-server/final-app-2.png)

## Notes

- Unlike normal web apps that can support dynamic or incremental consent, in Blazor you need to request all the scopes necessary for your application up front. Failing to do so will cause an error as the TokenAcquisition method will be unable to validate the token against the new permissions. This is part of the Blazor mechanics so something to keep in mind when creating your apps.

- In general, you should leverage the Microsoft Graph SDK which simplifies the interaction with Microsoft Graph and provides all the data objects you’ll need to serialize and deserialize from, rather than creating custom Http requests.
