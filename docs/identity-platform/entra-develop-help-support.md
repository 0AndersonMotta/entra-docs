# Support and help options for developers 

If you need help or support for development-related questions, use one of the following options:

## Search

If you have a development-related question, you may be able to find the answer you need on our documentation, our [github samples](https://github.com/azure-samples), or [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com).

Type your problem, question or error on the following search box to search on Stack Overflow, our documentation, and our code samples:
<br/><br/>
<div>
<form method="get" class="clearFilter" action="http://www.bing.com/search" target="_blank">
<input aria-label="Bing scoped search" type="search" placeholder="Bing scoped search" name="q" size="45" style="box-sizing: border-box;font-size: 0.87rem;height: 36px;line-height: 1.8; padding: 0 10px;">
<a title="Clear Filter" class="clearInput" href="#"><span class="visually-hidden">Clear Filter</span></a>
<input type="submit" value="Search" />
<input type="hidden" name="q1" value="(site:stackoverflow.com OR site:docs.microsoft.com OR site:github.com/azure-samples OR site:cloudidentity.com OR site:developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph)" /></td></tr>
</form>
</div>
