# Support and help options for developers 

If you need help or support for development-related questions, use one of the following options:

## 1. Search

If you have a development-related question, you may be able to find the answer you need on our documentation, our [github samples](https://github.com/azure-samples), or [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com).

Type your problem, question or error on the following search box to search on Stack Overflow, our documentation, and our code samples:
<br/><br/>
<div>
<form method="get" class="clearFilter" action="http://www.bing.com/search" target="_blank">
<input aria-label="Bing scoped search" type="search" placeholder="Bing scoped search" name="q" size="45" style="box-sizing: border-box;font-size: 0.87rem;height: 36px;line-height: 1.8; padding: 0 10px;">
<a title="Clear Filter" class="clearInput" href="#"><span class="visually-hidden">Clear Filter</span></a>
<input type="submit" value="Search" />
<input type="hidden" name="q1" value="(site:stackoverflow.com OR site:docs.microsoft.com OR site:github.com/azure-samples OR site:cloudidentity.com OR site:developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph)" /></td></tr>
</form>
</div>

## 2. Use our development support tools

## 3. Post a question to Stack Overflow
[![Stack Overflow](media/active-directory-develop-get-help/stackoverflow-logo.png)](https://www.stackoverflow.com)

Stack Overflow is the preferred channel for development-related questions - where both members of community as Microsoft team members are directly involved on helping you to solve your problem.

If you cannot find an answer to your problem via search, submit a new question to Stack Overflow: use one of the following tags when making questions to help the community identify, then answer your question on a timely manner:

|Component/Area  |Tags  |
|---------|---------|
|ADAL library |[[adal]](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/adal)|
|MSAL library     |[[msal]](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/msal)|
|OWIN middleware  |[[azure-active-directory]](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure-active-directory)|

|[Azure B2C](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory-b2c/)  |[[azure-ad-b2c]](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure-ad-b2b)|
