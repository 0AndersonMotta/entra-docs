# How to: Enable security defaults in Azure AD

Security defaults make it easier to help protect organizations from common attacks with preconfigured security settings

For more information about these settings, see the article [Security defaults in Azure AD](concept-fundamentals-security-defaults.md).

Microsoft is making security defaults available to everyone. The goal is to ensure that all organizations have a basic level of security enabled at no extra cost. You turn on security defaults in the Azure portal.
