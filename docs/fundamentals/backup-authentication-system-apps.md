# Application support for the backup authentication system 

The Azure AD backup authentication system provides resilience to applications that use supported protocols and flows. For more information about the backup authentication system, see the article [Azure AD's backup authentication system](backup-authentication-system.md).

## Application requirements for protection 

Applications must communicate with a supported hostname for the given Azure environment and use protocols currently supported by the backup authentication system. Use of authentication libraries, such as the [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](../develop/msal-overview.md), ensures that you're using authentication protocols supported by the backup authentication system.  

### Hostnames supported by the backup authentication system
 
| Azure environment | Supported hostname |
| --- |--- |
| Azure Commercial | login.microsoftonline.com |
| Azure Government | login.microsoftonline.us | 

### Authentication protocols supported by the backup authentication system

#### OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) 

##### Common guidance 

All applications using the OAuth 2.0 and/or OIDC protocols should adhere to the following practices to ensure resilience: 

- Your application uses MSAL or strictly adheres to the OpenID Connect & OAuth2 specifications. Microsoft recommends using MSAL libraries appropriate to your platform and use case. Using these libraries ensures the use of APIs and call patterns are supportable by the backup authentication system. 
- Your application uses a fixed set of scopes instead of [dynamic consent](../develop/scopes-oidc.md) when acquiring access tokens.  
- Your application doesn't use the [Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant](../develop/v2-oauth-ropc.md). **This grant type won't be supported** by the backup authentication system for any client type. Microsoft strongly recommends switching to alternative grant flows for better security and resilience. 
- Your application doesn't rely upon the [UserInfo endpoint](../develop/userinfo.md). Switching to using an ID token instead reduces latency by eliminating up to two network requests, and use existing support for ID token resilience within the backup authentication system. 

##### Native applications 

Native applications are public client applications that run directly on desktop or mobile devices and not in a web browser. They're registered as public clients in their application registration on the Microsoft Entra or Azure portal. 

Native applications are protected by the backup authentication system when all the following are true: 

1. Your application persists the token cache for at least three days. Your application should use the deviceâ€™s token cache location or the [token cache serialization API](../develop/msal-net-token-cache-serialization.md) to persist the token cache even when the user closes the application. 
1. Your application makes use of the MSAL [AcquireTokenSilent API](../develop/msal-net-acquire-token-silently.md) to retrieve tokens using cached Refresh Tokens. The use of the [AcquireTokenInteractive API](../develop/scenario-desktop-acquire-token-interactive.md) may fail to acquire a token from the backup authentication system if user interaction is required. 

The [device authorization grant](../develop/v2-oauth2-device-code.md) flow isn't currently supported by the backup authentication system.

##### Single-page web applications 

Single-page web applications (SPAs) have limited support in the backup authentication system. SPAs that use the [implicit grant flow](../develop/v2-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow.md) and request only OpenID Connect ID tokens are protected. Only apps that either use MSAL.js 1.x or implement the implicit grant flow directly can use this protection, as MSAL.js 2.x doesn't support the implicit flow.  

The [authorization code flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange](../develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow.md) isn't currently supported by the backup authentication system. 

##### Web applications & services 

Web applications and services that are configured as confidential clients aren't yet supported by the backup authentication system. Protection for the [authorization code grant flow](../develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow.md) and subsequent token acquisition using refresh tokens and client secrets or [certificate credentials](../develop/active-directory-certificate-credentials.md) is expected by September 2024. The OAuth 2.0 [on-behalf-of flow](../develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow.md) will be protected, although a date isn't yet available.  

#### SAML 2.0 single sign-on (SSO) 

The SAML 2.0 SSO protocol is currently partially supported by the backup authentication system. Flows that use the SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP) Initiated flow are protected by the Backup Authentication Service. Most applications should and do use the [Service Provider (SP) Initiated flow](../develop/single-sign-on-saml-protocol.md), which isn't yet protected by the backup authentication system. The backup authentication system will support SP-Initiated SSO flows by March 2024.  

### Workload identity authentication protocols supported by the backup authentication system

#### OAuth 2.0 

##### Managed identity 

Applications that use Managed Identities to acquire Azure Active Directory access tokens are protected. Microsoft recommends the use of user-assigned managed identities in most scenarios, however this protection applies to both [user and system-assigned managed identities](../managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md). 

##### Service principal 

Service principal-based Workload identity authentication using the [client credentials grant flow](../develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md) isn't yet supported by the backup authentication system. Microsoft recommends using the version of MSAL appropriate to your platform so your application will be protected by the backup authentication system when the protection becomes available in December 2024.
