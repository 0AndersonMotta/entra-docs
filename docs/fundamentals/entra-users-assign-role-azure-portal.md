# Assign a user to administrator roles in Azure Active Directory
This article explains how to assign an administrative role to a user in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). For information about adding new users in your organization, see [Add new users to Azure Active Directory](../add-users-azure-active-directory.md). Added users don't have administrator permissions by default, but you can assign roles to them at any time.

## Assign a role to a user
1. Sign in to the [Azure AD admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com) with an account that's a global admin for the directory.

2. Select **Users**, and then select a specific user from the list.

3. For the selected user, select **Directory role**, seclet **Add role**, and then pick the appropriate admin roles from the **Directory roles** list. For more information about administrative roles, see [Assigning administrator roles in Azure AD](../active-directory-assign-admin-roles-azure-portal.md).
