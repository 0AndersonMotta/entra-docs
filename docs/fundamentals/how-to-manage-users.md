# Manage users in Azure Active Directory






## Add a new user

You can create a new user using the Azure Active Directory portal.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) in the User Administrator role for the organization.

1. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Users** > **New user**.

    ![Screenshot of adding a new user from the All users page.](media/add-users-azure-active-directory/add-user-in-users-all-users.png)

1. On the **User** page, provide the new user's information:

   - **Name**. Required. The first and last name of the new user. For example, *Mary Parker*.

   - **User name**. Required. The user name of the new user. For example, `mary@contoso.com`. The user name and email address cannot contain accent characters.

     The domain part of the user name must use either the initial default domain name, *\<yourdomainname>.onmicrosoft.com*, or a custom domain name, such as *contoso.com*. For more information about how to create a custom domain name, see [Add your custom domain name using the Azure Active Directory portal](add-custom-domain.md).

   - **Groups**. Optionally, you can add the user to one or more existing groups. You can also add the user to groups at a later time. For more information about adding users to groups, see the [manage groups article](how-to-manage-groups.md).

   - **Directory role**: If you require Azure AD administrative permissions for the user, you can assign an Azure AD role. For more information about assigning roles, see [How to assign roles to users](active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal.md).

   - **Job info**: You can add more information about the user here, or do it later. For more information about adding user info, see [How to add or change user profile information](active-directory-users-profile-azure-portal.md).

1. Copy the autogenerated password provided in the **Password** box. You'll need to give this password to the user to sign in for the first time.

1. Select **Create**.

The user is created and added to your Azure AD organization.



## Add or change profile information
Add user profile information such as a profile picture and job-specific information using Azure Azure AD. Only basic information is added when new users are created, so you'll need to add these details after they're added to your organization.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) in the User Administrator role for the organization.

1. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Users** > select a user.

    ![Screenshot of a user's profile page, including editable information.](media/active-directory-users-profile-azure-portal/user-profile-all-blade.png)

1. Select **Edit** to optionally add or update the information included in each of the editable sections.

    - **Profile picture.** Select a thumbnail image for the user's account. This picture appears in Azure AD and on the user's personal pages, such as the myapps.microsoft.com page.

    - **Identity.** Add or update an additional identity value for the user, such as a married last name. You can set this name independently from the values of First name and Last name. For example, you could use it to include initials, a company name, or to change the sequence of names shown. In another example, for two users whose names are ‘Chris Green’ you could use the Identity string to set their names to 'Chris B. Green' 'Chris R. Green (Contoso).'

    - **Job info.** Add any job-related information, such as the user's job title, department, or manager.

    - **Settings.** Decide whether the user can sign in to Azure AD tenant. You can also specify the user's global location.

    - **Contact info.** Add any relevant contact information for the user, except for some user's phone or mobile contact info (only a Global Administrator can update users in administrator roles).

    - **Authentication contact info.** Verify this information to make sure there's an active phone number and email address for the user. This information is used by Azure AD to authenticate user during sign-in. Authentication contact info can be updated only by a Global Administrator.

1. Select **Save**.

All your changes are saved for the user.

>[!Note]
>You must use Windows Server Active Directory to update the identity, contact info, or job info for users whose source of authority is Windows Server Active Directory. After you complete your update, you must wait for the next synchronization cycle to complete before you'll see the changes.
>
> If you're having issues updating a user's Profile picture, please ensure that your Office 365 Exchange Online Enterprise App is Enabled for users to sign-in.



## Assign roles to users

If one of your users needs permission to manage Azure AD resources, you must assign them to a role that provides the permissions they need. New to Azure or need a refresher on all the roles? Take a moment to review these articles:

- [Classic subscription administrator roles, Azure roles, and Azure AD roles](../../role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles.md)

- [Assigning administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](../roles/permissions-reference.md)

- [Least privileged roles by task in Azure Active Directory](../roles/delegate-by-task.md)

- [Privileged Identity Management](../privileged-identity-management/index.yml)

A common way to assign Azure AD roles to a user is on the **Assigned roles** page for a user. You can also configure the user eligibility to be elevated just-in-time into a role using Privileged Identity Management (PIM). For more information about how to use PIM, see [Privileged Identity Management](../privileged-identity-management/index.yml).

> [!Note]
> If you have an Azure AD Premium P2 license plan and already use PIM, all role management tasks are performed in the [Privileged Identity Management experience](../roles/manage-roles-portal.md). This feature is currently limited to assigning only one role at a time. You can't currently select multiple roles and assign them to a user all at once.

## Assign a role to a user

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in using a Global administrator account for the directory.

2. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory**.

      ![Azure portal search for Azure Active Directory](media/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal/search-azure-active-directory.png)

3. Select **Users**.

4. Search for and select the user getting the role assignment. For example, _Alain Charon_.

      ![All users page - select the user](media/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal/directory-role-select-user.png)

5. On the **Alain Charon - Profile** page, select **Assigned roles**.

    The **Alain Charon - Administrative roles** page appears.

6. Select **Add assignments**, select the role to assign to Alain (for example, _Application administrator_), and then choose **Select**.

    ![Assigned roles page - showing the selected role](media/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal/directory-role-select-role.png)

    The Application administrator role is assigned to Alain Charon and it appears on the **Alain Charon - Administrative roles** page.

## Remove a role assignment

If you need to remove the role assignment from a user, you can also do that from the **Alain Charon - Administrative roles** page.

### To remove a role assignment from a user

1. Select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then search for and select the user getting the role assignment removed. For example, _Alain Charon_.

2. Select **Assigned roles**, select **Application administrator**, and then select **Remove assignment**.

    ![Assigned roles page, showing the selected role and the remove option](media/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal/directory-role-remove-role.png)

    The Application administrator role is removed from Alain Charon and it no longer appears on the **Alain Charon - Administrative roles** page.
