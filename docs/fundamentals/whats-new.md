## February 2024

### General Availability - Identity Protection and Risk Remediation on the Azure Mobile App

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Identity Protection    
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection    

Previously supported only on the portal, Identity Protection is a powerful tool that empowers administrators to proactively manage identity risks. Now available on the Azure Mobile app, administrators can respond to potential threats with ease and efficiency. This feature includes comprehensive reporting, offering insights into risky behaviors such as compromised user accounts and suspicious sign-ins.

With the Risky users report, administrators gain visibility into accounts flagged as compromised or vulnerable. Actions such as blocking/unblocking sign-ins, confirming the legitimacy of compromises, or resetting passwords are conveniently accessible, ensuring timely risk mitigation.

Additionally, the Risky sign-ins report provides a detailed overview of suspicious sign-in activities, aiding administrators in identifying potential security breaches. While capabilities on mobile are limited to viewing sign-in details, administrators can take necessary actions through the portal, such as blocking sign-ins. Alternatively, admins can choose to manage the corresponding risky user's account until all risks are mitigated.

Stay ahead of identity risks effortlessly with Identity Protection on the Azure Mobile app. These capabilities are intended to provide user with the tools to maintain a secure environment and peace of mind for their organization.

The mobile app can be downloaded at the following links:

### Decommissioning of Group Writeback V2 (Public Preview) in Entra Connect Sync

**Type:** Plan for change   
**Service category:** Provisioning                     
**Product capability:**  Microsoft Entra Connect Sync             

The public preview of Group Writeback V2 (GWB) in Entra Connect Sync will no longer be available after June 30, 2024. After this date, Connect Sync will no longer support provisioning cloud security groups to Active Directory.

Another similar functionality is offered in Entra Cloud Sync, called “*Group Provision to AD*”, that maybe used instead of GWB V2 for provisioning cloud security groups to AD. Enhanced functionality in Cloud Sync, along with other new features, are being developed.

Customers who use this preview feature in Connect Sync should [switch their configuration from Connect Sync to Cloud Sync](../identity/hybrid/cloud-sync/migrate-group-writeback.md). Customers can choose to move all their hybrid sync to Cloud Sync (if it supports their needs) or Cloud Sync can be run side-by-side and move only cloud security group provisioning to AD onto Cloud Sync.

Customers who provision Microsoft 365 groups to AD can continue using GWB V1 for this capability.  

Customers can evaluate moving exclusively to Cloud Sync by using this wizard: https://aka.ms/EvaluateSyncOptions

### General Availability - Windows MAM

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Conditional Access                     
**Product capability:** Access Control            

Windows MAM is the first step toward Microsoft management capabilities for unmanaged Windows devices. This functionality comes at a critical time when we need to ensure the Windows platform is on par with the simplicity and privacy promise we offer end users today on the mobile platforms. End users can access company resources without needing the whole device to be MDM managed.

### General Availability - Microsoft Security email update and Resources for Azure AD rename to Microsoft Entra ID 

**Type:** Plan for change   
**Service category:** Other                     
**Product capability:** End User Experiences            

Microsoft Entra ID is the new name for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). The rename and new product icon are now being deployed across experiences from Microsoft. Most updates are complete by mid-November of this year. As previously announced, this is just a new name, with no impact on deployments or daily work. There are no changes to capabilities, licensing, terms of service, or support.

From October 15 to November 15, Azure AD emails previously sent from azure-noreply@microsoft.com will start being sent from MSSecurity-noreply@microsoft.com. You might need to update your Outlook rules to match this.  

Additionally, we'll update email content to remove all references of Azure AD where relevant, and include an informational banner that announces this change.

Here are some resources to guide you rename your own product experiences or content where necessary:

### General Availability - Restrict Microsoft Entra ID Tenant Creation To Only Paid Subscription  

**Type:** Changed feature   
**Service category:** Managed identities for Azure resources                    
**Product capability:** End User Experiences            

The ability to create new tenants from the Microsoft Entra admin center allows users in your organization to create test and demo tenants from your Microsoft Entra ID tenant, [Learn more about creating tenants](/microsoft-365/education/deploy/intro-azure-active-directory). When used incorrectly this feature can allow the creation of tenants that aren't managed or viewable by your organization. We recommend that you restrict this capability so that only trusted admins can use this feature, [Learn more about restricting member users' default permissions](users-default-permissions.md#restrict-member-users-default-permissions). We also recommend you use the Microsoft Entra audit log to monitor for the Directory Management: Create Company event that signals a new tenant has been created by a user in your organization.  

To further protect your organization, Microsoft is now limiting this functionality to only paid customers. Customers on trial subscriptions are unable to create additional tenants from the Microsoft Entra admin center. Customers in this situation who need a new trial tenant can sign up for a [Free Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

### General Availability - Users can't modify GPS location when using location based access control

**Type:** Plan for change   
**Service category:** Conditional Access                     
**Product capability:** User Authentication            

In an ever-evolving security landscape, the Microsoft Authenticator is updating its security baseline for Location Based Access Control (LBAC) conditional access policies to disallow authentications where the user might be using a different location than the actual GPS location of the mobile device. Today, it's possible for users to modify the location reported by the device on iOS and Android devices. The Authenticator app starts to deny LBAC authentications where we detect that the user isn't using the actual location of the mobile device where the Authenticator is installed.

In the November 2023 release of the Authenticator app, users who are modifying the location of their device sees a denial message in the app when doing an LBAC authentication. To ensure that users aren’t using older app versions to continue authenticating with a modified location, beginning January 2024, any users that are on Android Authenticator 6.2309.6329 version or prior and iOS Authenticator version 6.7.16 or prior will be blocked from using LBAC. To determine which users are using older versions of the Authenticator app, you can use [our MSGraph APIs](/graph/api/resources/microsoftauthenticatorauthenticationmethod).

### Public Preview - Changes to FIDO2 authentication methods and Windows Hello for Business

**Type:**  Changed feature            
**Service category:**  Authentications (Logins)                                
**Product capability:**  User Authentication                        

Beginning **January 2024**, Microsoft Entra ID supports [device-bound passkeys](https://passkeys.dev/docs/reference/terms/#device-bound-passkey) stored on computers and mobile devices as an authentication method in public preview, in addition to the existing support for FIDO2 security keys. This enables your users to perform phishing-resistant authentication using the devices that they already have.  

We expand the existing FIDO2 authentication methods policy, and end user experiences, to support this preview release. For your organization to opt in to this preview, you need to enforce key restrictions to allow specified passkey providers in your FIDO2 policy. Learn more about FIDO2 key restrictions [here](~/identity/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key.md).

In addition, the existing end user sign-in option for Windows Hello and FIDO2 security keys are now indicated by “Face, fingerprint, PIN, or security key”. The term “passkey” will be mentioned in the updated sign-in experience to be inclusive of passkey credentials presented from security keys, mobile devices, and platform authenticators like Windows Hello.

### General Availability - Web Sign-In for Windows

**Type:** Changed feature              
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)                                 
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

We're thrilled to announce that as part of the Windows 11 September moment, we're releasing a new Web Sign-In experience that will expand the number of supported scenarios and greatly improve security, reliability, performance, and overall end-to-end experience for our users.

Web Sign-In (WSI) is a credential provider on the Windows lock/sign-in screen for AADJ joined devices that provide a web experience used for authentication and returns an auth token back to the operating system to allow the user to unlock/sign-in to the machine.

Web Sign-In was initially intended to be used for a wide range of auth credential scenarios; however, it was only previously released for limited scenarios such as: [Simplified EDU Web Sign-In](/education/windows/federated-sign-in?tabs=intune) and recovery flows via [Temporary Access Password (TAP)](~/identity/authentication/howto-authentication-temporary-access-pass.md).

The underlying provider for Web Sign-In is re-written from the ground up with security and improved performance in mind. This release moves the Web Sign-in infrastructure from the Cloud Host Experience (CHX) WebApp to a newly written Login Web Host (LWH) for the September moment. This release provides better security and reliability to support previous EDU & TAP experiences and new workflows enabling using various Auth Methods to unlock/login to the desktop.
