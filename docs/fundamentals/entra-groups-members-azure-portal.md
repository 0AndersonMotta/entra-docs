# How to: Add or remove members or devices from a group using the Azure AD portal
Using the Azure AD portal, you can continue to add and remove members from groups.

## To add or remove members

1. From the **Groups - All groups** blade, select the group you want to update. In this case, use our previously created group, **MDM policy - West**.

    ![Groups-All groups blade, group name highlighted](media/create-basic-group-azure-portal/group-all-groups-screen.png)

2. Select **Members**, and then select **Add members**.

    The **Add members** blade appears.

    ![Add members blade, with searched for member shown](media/create-basic-group-azure-portal/update-members.png)

3. Select each of the members you want to include in your group, and then choose **Select**.

    You'll get a message that says the member was added successfully.

4. Refresh the screen to see all of the member names.
