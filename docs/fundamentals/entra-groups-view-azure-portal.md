# Quickstart: Search for and view your groups and assigned members using the Azure AD portal

You can search for a specific group, or see all of your groups, and view the assigned members.

## To search for a specific group
1. Sign in to the [Azure AD portal](https://portal.azure.com) using a Global administrator account for the directory.

2. Select **Azure Active Directory**, and then select **Groups**.

    The **Groups - All groups** blade appears, showing all of your active groups.

3. From the **Groups - All groups** blade, type as much of the group name as you can into the **Search** box. For the purposes of this article, we're searching for the **MDM policy - West** group.

    The search results appear under the **Search** box, updating as you type more characters.

4. Select the group **MDM policy - West** and view the group info on the **Group Overview** blade, including the number of members of that group.

5. Select **Members** from the **Manage** area, and review the complete list of member names assigned to that specific group.
