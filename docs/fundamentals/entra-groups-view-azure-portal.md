# Quickstart: Search for and view your groups and assigned members using the Azure AD portal
You can search for a specific group, or see all of your groups, and view the assigned members.

## To search for a specific group
1. Sign in to the [Azure AD portal](https://portal.azure.com) using a Global administrator account for the directory.

2. Select **Azure Active Directory**, and then select **Groups**.

    The **Groups - All groups** blade appears, showing all of your active groups.

3. From the **Groups - All groups** blade, type as much of the group name as you can into the **Search** box.

## To view assigned members
1. From the **Groups - All groups** blade, select the group name for which you want to see the members. In this case, _MDM policy - West_.

    The group information appears, with the number of included members.

2. Select **Members** from the **Manage** area, and review the complete list of members assigned to that specific group.
