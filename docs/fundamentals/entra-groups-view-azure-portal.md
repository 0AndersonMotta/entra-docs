# Quickstart: Search for and view your groups and assigned members using the Azure AD portal
Whether you add your members as part of the group creation process or later, you can always view your groups and associated members.

## To search for a specific group
1. Sign in to the [Azure AD portal](https://portal.azure.com) using a Global administrator account for the directory.

2. Select **Azure Active Directory**, and then select **Groups**

2. From the **Groups - All groups** blade, type in as much of the group name as you can into the **Search** box.

## To view all groups and assigned members
1. Select **Groups**, and then select your group name. In this case, _MDM policy - West_.

    The group information appears, with the number of included members.

2. If you want to see the member names, select **Members** from the **Manage** area, and review the list.
