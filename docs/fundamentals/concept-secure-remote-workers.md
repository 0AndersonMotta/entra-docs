# Rapid response to secure identities with Azure AD

It can seem daunting trying to secure your workers in today's world, especially when you have to respond rapidly and provide access to many services quickly. This article is meant to provide a concise list of all the actions to take, helping you identify and prioritize which order to deploy the Azure AD features based on the license type you own. Azure AD offers many features and provides many layers of security for your Identities, navigating which feature is relevant can sometimes be overwhelming. Many organizations are already in the cloud or moving quickly to the cloud, this document is intended to allow you to deploy services quickly, with securing your identities as the primary consideration. 

Each table provides a consistent security recommendation, protecting both Administrator and User identities from the main security attacks (breach replay, phishing, and password spray) while minimizing the user impact and improving the user experience. 

The guidance will also allow administrators to configure access to SaaS and on-premises applications in a secure and protected manner and is applicable to either cloud or hybrid (synced) identities and applies to users working remotely or in the office.

This checklist will help you quickly deploy critical recommended actions to protect your organization immediately by explaining how to:

- Strengthen your credentials.
- Reduce your attack surface area.
- Automate threat response.
- Utilize cloud intelligence.
- Enable end-user self-service.

## Secure Access for remote workers 

\* requires Azure AD premium P1 licenses.
\** requires Azure AD premium P2 licenses.

### Guidance for Azure AD Free or Office 365 customers.

There are a number of recommendations that Azure AD Free or OFFICE 365 app customers should take to protect their user identities, the following table is intended to highlight the key actions for the following license subscriptions:

- Office 365 (O365 E1 / E3 / E5 / F1 / A1 /A3 /A5)
- Office 365 Business (Essentials / Business /Business Premium)
- Microsoft 365 (M365 Business / A1)
- Azure AD Free (included with Azure, Dynamics 365, Intune, and Power Platform

#### Azure AD Free Customers / OFFICE 365 APPS (O365 E1, E3, E5, F1, A1)

| Recommended action | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| [Enable Security Defaults](concept-fundamentals-security-defaults.md) | Protect all user identities and applications by enabling MFA and blocking legacy authentication |
| [Enable Password Hash Sync](../hybrid/how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronization.md) (if using hybrid identities) | Provide redundancy for authentication and improve security (including Smart Lockout, IP Lockout, and the ability to discover leaked credentials.) |
| [Enable ADFS smart lock out](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-ad-fs-extranet-smart-lockout-protection) (If applicable) | Protects your users from experiencing extranet account lockout from malicious activity. |
| [Enable Azure Active Directory smart lockout](../authentication/howto-password-smart-lockout.md) (if using hybrid identities) | Smart lockout assists in locking out bad actors who are trying to guess your users' passwords or use brute-force methods to get in. |
| [Disable end-user consent to applications](../manage-apps/configure-user-consent.md) | The admin consent workflow gives admins a secure way to grant access to applications that require admin approval so end users do not expose corporate data. Microsoft recommends disabling future user consent operations to help reduce your surface area and mitigate this risk. |
| [Integrate supported SaaS applications from the gallery to Azure AD and enable Single sign on](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md) | Azure AD has a gallery that contains thousands of pre-integrated applications. Some of the applications your organization uses are probably in the gallery accessible directly from the Azure portal. Provide access to corporate SaaS applications remotely and securely with improved user experience (SSO) |
| [Enable Secure hybrid access: Secure legacy apps with existing app delivery controllers and networks](../manage-apps/secure-hybrid-access.md) (if applicable) | Publish and protect your on-premises and cloud legacy authentication applications by connecting them to Azure AD with your existing application delivery controller or network. |
| [Enable self-service password reset](../authentication/tutorial-enable-sspr.md) (applicable to cloud only accounts) | This ability reduces help desk calls and loss of productivity when a user cannot sign into their device or an application. (applicable to cloud only accounts) |
| [Use non-global administrative roles where possible](../users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles.md) | Give your administrators only the access they need to only the areas they need access to. Not all administrators need to be global administrators. |
| [Enable Microsoft's password guidance](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/password-guidance/) | Stop requiring users to change their password on a set schedule, disable complexity requirements, and your users are more apt to remember their passwords and keep them something that is secure. |
| [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning from SaaS Applications](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md) (if applicable) | Automatically create user identities and roles in the cloud (SaaS) applications that users need access to. In addition to creating user identities, automatic provisioning includes the maintenance and removal of user identities as status or roles change, increasing your organization's security. |
