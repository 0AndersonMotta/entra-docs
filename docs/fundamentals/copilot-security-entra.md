# Security Copilot in Microsoft Entra

**Applies to:**

- Microsoft Entra

The Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft Entra Early Access Program is an invitation-only, paid preview. If your organization is interested in this program, work with your Microsoft account manager to learn more about nominations for a potential invite. To learn more about this program, see the [Microsoft Security Copilot Early Access Program FAQ](/security-copilot/faq-security-copilot).

If you use [Microsoft Entra](/entra/fundamentals/whatis), then you can use Security Copilot to investigate and resolve identity risks, assess identities and access with AI-driven intelligence, and complete complex tasks quickly.

Specifically, Security Copilot gets insights from your Microsoft Entra users, groups, sign-in logs, audit logs, and more. You can explore sign-ins and risky users and get contextualized insights on how to resolve and what to do to protect the accounts in natural language.  Built on top of real-time machine learning, Security Copilot can help you find gaps in access policies, generate identity workflows, and troubleshoot faster. You can also unlock new skills that allow admins at all levels to complete complex tasks such as incident investigation, sign-in log analysis, and more, to gain savings in time and resources.

This article introduces you to Security Copilot and includes sample prompts that can help Microsoft Entra admins.
