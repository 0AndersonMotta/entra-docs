## Pre-requisites

- [Configure your tenant](verifiable-credentials-configure-tenant.md) for Entra Verified ID service.
- If needed, [create an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

## Scenario description

[Account onboarding](plan-verification-solution.md#account-onboarding) - Verifiable credentials from LexisNexis Risk Solutions (Trusted ID proofing issuer per below figure) can be used to enable faster onboarding by replacing some human interactions. VCs can be used to onboard employees, students, citizens, or others to access services. For example, rather than an employee needing to go to a central office to activate an employee badge, they can use a VC to verify their identity to activate a badge that is delivered to them remotely. Rather than a citizen receiving a code they must redeem to access governmental services, they can use a VC to prove their identity and gain access.
