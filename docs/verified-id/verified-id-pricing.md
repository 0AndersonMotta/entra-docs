# Billing model for Microsoft Entra Verified ID Face Check

Microsoft Entra Verified ID pricing is based on the unique Face Check verification count within a calendar month by a verifier authority. Consumption based billing helps you manage costs by only paying the Face Check transactions used. In this article, learn about consumptive billing and linking your Verified ID authority to an Azure subscription.

## About monthly Face Check verifications billing

In your Microsoft Verified ID, you can verify credentials from issuer authorities that you trust. In addition with Face Check, your organization can perform high-assurance verifications securely, simply, and at scale by performing facial matching between a userâ€™s real-time selfie and a photo. Verified ID generates individual billing events for each unique verification performed by the platform. Whether that verification succeeds or fails.

## Link your Verified ID authority to a subscription

1. Go to the Verified ID overview page. Scroll down to the new Add-ons section and `Enable` the Face Check add-on

## What if I can't find a subscription?
If no subscriptions are available in the Link a subscription pane, here are some possible reasons:

You don't have the appropriate permissions. Be sure to sign in with an Azure account that is assigned at least the Contributor role within the subscription or a resource group within the subscription.

A subscription exists, but it isn't associated with your directory yet. You can [associate an existing subscription to your tenant](/entra/fundamentals/how-subscriptions-associated-directory) and then repeat the steps for linking it to your tenant.

No subscription exists. In the Link a subscription pane, you can create a subscription by selecting the link if you don't already have a subscription you might create one here. After you create a new subscription, you'll need to [create a resource group](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal) in the new subscription, and then repeat the steps for linking it to your tenant.
