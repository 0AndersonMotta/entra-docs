## What if I can't find a subscription?
If no subscriptions are available in the Link a subscription pane, here are some possible reasons:

You don't have the appropriate permissions. Be sure to sign in with an Azure account that's assigned at least the Contributor role within the subscription or a resource group within the subscription.

A subscription exists, but it isn't associated with your directory yet. You can [associate an existing subscription to your tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/how-subscriptions-associated-directory) and then repeat the steps for linking it to your tenant.

No subscription exists. In the Link a subscription pane, you can create a subscription by selecting the link if you don't already have a subscription you may create one here. After you create a new subscription, you'll need to [create a resource group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal]) in the new subscription, and then repeat the steps for linking it to your tenant..
