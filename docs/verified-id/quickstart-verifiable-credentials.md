# Quickstart: Issue and Validate verifiable credentials using a sample app (Preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Verifiable Credentials is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Get started with Azure Active Directory Verifiable Credentials by using the Verifiable Credentials sample app to issue your first verifiable credential.

In this quickstart, we go over the steps needed to issue your first verifiable credential: a Verified Credential Ninja Card. You can then use this card to prove to a verifier that you are a Verified Credential Ninja, mastered in the art of digital credentialing.

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019)
- NodeJS version 10.14 or higher installed on the system that will be hosting the sample app.
- If you want to clone the repository that hosts the sample app you need [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
- An Android device with Microsoft Authenticator version 6.2005.3599 or higher installed.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NGROK](https://ngrok.com/)

## Download the sample code

To issue yourself a Verified Credential Ninja Card, you'll need to run a website on your local machine. The website will be used to initiate a verifiable credential issuance process. We've provided a simple website, written in NodeJS, that we'll use throughout this tutorial.

First, download our sample code from GitHub [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-verifiable-credentials), or clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-verifiable-credentials.git
```

You may want to familiarize yourself with the code in the sample websites. The `issuer` folder contains all code used to issue a verifiable credential. More details are available in the sample's [readme](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-verifiable-credentials).

## Run the issuer website

When you run the sample website, your android device will need to communicate with the Node server running on your local machine. To do this, we recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). **ngrok** is an easy way to expose your local development server though the public web. 

After you've installed **ngrok**, expose your local Node website over https using **ngrok**. By default the sample website runs on port `8081`. **Ngrok** will output two forwarding URLs for your server. Copy the URL with the `https://` prefix.


```cmd
ngrok http 8081
```
![ngrok helps you make your application end points available over the internet](/media/quickstart-verifiable-credentials/ngrok.png)

>[!NOTE]
> You may need to $cd into the folder where you installed ngrok.

Now that your local port is exposed through ngrok, the sample automatically uses the host used so make sure you open the website with the hostname generated by ngrok.

You're now ready to run the sample website and issue yourself a Verified Credential Ninja Card. 

Make sure you've navigated to the `issuer` folder. Install all necessary packages, and start the node server. Navigate to the website's homepage, which runs on port `8081` by default.

```bash
cd ./issuer
npm install
node ./app.js
```

If you navigate to the ngrok forwarding URL on your android device, you should be able to successfully visit the homepage of the sample website. Check this to ensure your android device can communicate to your local server.

## Issue a credential

Before you can receive your verifiable credential, you'll need the Microsoft Authenticator app. Microsoft Authenticator will be used to receive, store, and present your verifiable credentials to interested parties. Install Microsoft Authenticator on your device.

Next, issue yourself a verifiable credential. The sample website displays a QR code, which can be scanned using Authenticator. The website also displays a deep link, which you can tap if you visit the website in your device's mobile browser.

![ngrok_url](/media/quickstart-verifiable-credentials/ngrok_url.png)

Scan the website's QR code using Authenticator, or tap the website's deep link. To get your Ninja Card, you'll be prompted to sign in with your Credential Ninja account. Don't worry, you can quickly create an account if necessary. After you've signed in, accept your Verified Credential Ninja Card.

Congratulations! You are now a verified credentialing Ninja. But this is just the beginning of your Verifiable Credentials journey, it's time to verify your credential.  

## Validate credentials

Now that you've completed the issuance portion of the quickstart and you already have the Verifiable Credential in Authenticator, it's time to validate it in your own verifier app. 

Stop running your issuer ngrok service.
```bash
control-c
```
Now run ngrok with the verifier port 8082.
```bash
$.\ngrok http 8082
```

In another terminal window, open the Verifier app folder and run it similarly to how we ran the issuer app.

```bash
cd ./verifier
npm install
node ./app.js
```

Open the ngrok forwarding url in your browser and tap on the button. 

Open Authenticator in the Credentials tab and tap on the QR code icon. On iOS, it is the top right and on Android it is the bottom right. Scan the QR code and choose **Allow** on the new permission request screen in Authenticator.  

After a successful presentation three things should have been updated:

- The webpage should now display the attributes of your name "is a Verified Credential Ninja".
- Your verifier app terminal should also display the same message from the logs.
- In Authenticator, there should be an entry for recent activity of this presentation.

## Next steps

Now that you have successfully completed the quick start guide, it's time to create your own Decentralized identifier in the Azure AD verifiable credentials service and issue your own verifiable credential.
