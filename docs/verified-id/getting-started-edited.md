# Issue your first verifiable credential (preview)

This tutorial shows you how to issue and use your first verifiable credential: Ninja Card. Verifiable credentials are 'insert description of what VCs are' In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Issue a verifiable credential ninja card
> * Accept a verifiable credential in Microsoft Authenticator app. 
> * Present and verify the verifiable credential ninja card.

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- A system to host our sample site.
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 10.14 or higher.
- You need [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed If you want to clone the repository that hosts the sample app,
- A mobile device with Microsoft Authenticator version 6.2005.3599 or higher installed.
- [NGROK](https://ngrok.com/) free.
- Download the [active directory verifiable credentials](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-verifiable-credentials) sample code or clone the repository to your local machine:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-verifiable-credentials.git
```


## Run the issuer website

To issue a Verified Credential Ninja Card, you will need to run a website on your local machine that will initiate a verifiable credential issuance process. We've provided a simple website, written in NodeJS, that we use throughout this tutorial. The `issuer` folder contains all code used to issue a verifiable credential. More details are available in the sample's [readme](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-verifiable-credentials).

You can run the steps from within Visual Studio Code or any command line available in your operating system. 

1. Navigate to the `issuer` folder. 

    ```cmd
    cd issuer
    ```

2. Once there we need to install all required packages and start the site.

   ```cmd
    npm install
    node app.js
    ```

3. In the terminal, you will now see that your issuer app is listening on port 8081. Now let's set up a reverse proxy with Ngrok so Authenticator can communicate with your app. 

## Creating a reverse proxy with Ngrok

When you run the sample website, your device needs to communicate with the Node server running on your local machine. We recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) as an easy way to make your local development server available over the internet.

1. After you download and extract **ngrok**, we need to run:

    ```cmd
    ngrok http 8081
    ```

    By default the sample website runs on port `8081`. **Ngrok** outputs two forwarding URLs for your server. Copy the URL with the `https://` prefix.


    ![ngrok helps you make your application end points available over the internet](media/get-started-verifiable-credentials/ngrok.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    > If you are using PowerShell you may need to type ```./ngrok``` for the command to be recognized.

    Now that your local port is exposed to the internet, the sample site automatically uses the host name generated by ngrok. 
    
    Open your browser and navigate to the ngrok https forwarding URL. You should be able to successfully visit the sample site's homepage. If the page opens, your device can communicate with the sample app running on your local server.

    You're now ready to issue yourself a Verified Credential Ninja Card. 

## Issue a credential

Microsoft Authenticator is used to receive, store, and present verifiable credentials to interested parties. For this section, you will need Microsoft Authenticator version 6.2005.3599 or higher installed, on a mobile device.

1. On the sample website, click the Get Credential button. This will display a QR code. 

2. Using Microsoft Authenticator, click the QR code button to scan the code from step 1. 

3. When prompted to sign in with your Ninja account, click sign-up to create a new user account in our B2C tenant.

4. Click accept in authenticator to receive your Verified Credential Ninja Card.

Congratulations! You are now a verified credentialing Ninja. Now it is time to use your credential.  

## Validate credentials

Now that you have a verifiable credential in Authenticator, it is time to validate it with your own verifier app. 

1. Stop running your issuer ngrok service.

    ```cmd
    control+c
    ```


2. In another terminal window, open the Verifier app folder and run it similarly to how we ran the issuer app.

    ```cmd
    cd verifier
    npm install
    node app.js
    ```

3. Now run ngrok with the verifier port 8082.

    ```cmd
    ngrok http 8082
    ```

4. Open the ngrok https forwarding url in your browser and tap on the prove ninja card button.

5. Open Authenticator in the Credentials tab and tap on the QR code icon.

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >On iOS, it is the top right and on Android it is the bottom right. Scan the QR code and choose.

6. Click **Allow** on the new permission request screen in Authenticator. 

7. If permission request is completed successfully:

    - The webpage should now display the attributes of your name "is a Verified Credential Ninja".
    - The verifier app terminal should also display the same message from the logs.
    - In Authenticator, there should be an entry for recent activity of the verified credential Ninja card. 

 >[!note]
> While running the verifier app, ngrok may stop working and display an error that there are too many connections. We've found this can be avoided by registering your account with ngrok. 

## Next steps

Now that you have successfully completed the quick start guide using our sample code, it's time to onboard your own tenant to Azure AD verifiable credentials service.
