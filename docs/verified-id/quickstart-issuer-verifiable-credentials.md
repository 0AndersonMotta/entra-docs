# Quickstart: Issue verifiable credentials using a sample app

Get started with Azure Active Directory Verifiable Credentials by using the Verifiable Credentials sample app to issue your first verifiable credential.

In this quickstart, we go over the steps needed to issue your first verifiable credential: a Verified Credential Ninja Card. You can then use this card to prove to a verifier that you are a Verified Credential Ninja, mastered in the art of digital credentialing.

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019)
- NodeJS version 10.14 or higher installed on the system that will be hosting the sample app.
- If you want to clone the repository that hosts the sample app you need [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
- An Android device with Microsoft Authenticator version 6.2005.3599 or higher installed.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NGROK](https://ngrok.com/)

## Download the sample code

To issue yourself a Verified Credential Ninja Card, you'll need to run a website on your local machine. The website will be used to initiate a verifiable credential issuance process. We've provided a simple website, written in NodeJS, that we'll use throughout this tutorial.

First, download our sample code from GitHub [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-verifiable-credentials), or clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-verifiable-credentials.git
```

You may want to familiarize yourself with the code in the sample websites. The `issuer` folder contains all code used to issue a verifiable credential. More details are available in the sample's [readme](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-verifiable-credentials).

## Run the issuer website

When you run the sample website, your android device will need to communicate with the Node server running on your local machine. To do this, we recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). Ngrok is an easy way to expose your local development server though the public web. 

After you've installed ngrok, expose your local Node website over https using ngrok. By default the sample website runs on port `8081`. Ngrok will output two forwarding URLs for your server. Copy the URL with the `https://` prefix.


```bash
ngrok http 8081
```

Now that your local port is exposed through ngrok, the sample automatically uses the host used so make sure you open the website with the hostname generated by ngrok.


You're now ready to run the sample website and issue yourself a Verified Credential Ninja Card. 

Make sure you've navigated to the `issuer` folder. Install all necessary packages, and start the node server. Navigate to the website's homepage, which runs on port `8081` by default.

```bash
cd ./issuer
npm install
node ./app.js
```

If you navigate to the ngrok forwarding URL on your android device, you should be able to successfully visit the homepage of the sample website. Check this to ensure your android device can communicate to your local server.

## Issue a credential

Before you can receive your verifiable credential, you'll need the Microsoft Authenticator app. Microsoft Authenticator will be used to receive, store, and present your verifiable credentials to interested parties. Install Microsoft Authenticator on your device.

Next, issue yourself a verifiable credential. The sample website displays a QR code, which can be scanned using Authenticator. The website also displays a deep link, which you can tap if you visit the website in your device's mobile browser.


Scan the website's QR code using Authenticator, or tap the website's deep link. To get your Ninja Card, you'll be prompted to sign in with your Credential Ninja account. Don't worry, you can quickly create an account if necessary. After you've signed in, accept your Verified Credential Ninja Card.


Congratulations! You are now a verified credentialing Ninja. But this is just the beginning of your Verifiable Credentials journey.
