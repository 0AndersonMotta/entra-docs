## Pre-requisites

- [Configure your tenant](verifiable-credentials-configure-tenant.md) for Entra Verified ID service.
- If needed, [create an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

## Scenario description

Account onboarding can be used to enable faster onboarding by replacing manual identity verification often prone to errors. Verified IDs can be used to digitally onboard employees, students, citizens, or others to securely access resources and services. For example, rather than an employee needing to go to a central office to activate an employee badge, they can use a Verified ID to verify their identity to activate a badge that is delivered to them remotely. Rather than a citizen receiving a code they must redeem to access governmental services, they can use a Verified ID to prove their identity and gain access.
