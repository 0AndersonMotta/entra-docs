Verifiable Credentials are made up of two components, the rules and display files. The Rules file determines what the user needs to do in order to receive a Verifiable Credential and the Display File controls the branding of the credential and styling of the claims. In this guide, we will explain how to modify both files to meet the requirements of your organization. 

## Rules File: Requirements from the user

The rules file is a simple JSON file that describes important properties of verifiable credentials. In particular it describes how claims are used to populate your Verifiable Credentials. 

There are currently 3 input types that that are available to configure in the rules file. These types are used by the Verifiable Credential Issuing service to insert claims into a Verifiable Credential and attest to that information with your DID. The following are the 3 types with explanations. 

- ID Token
- Verifiable Credentials via a Verifiable Presentation 
- Self Issued Claims


**ID Token:** The Sample App and Tutorial use the ID Token. When this option is selected, you will need to provide an Open ID Connect configuration URI and include the claims that should be included in the VC. The user will be prompted to 'Sign In' on the Authenticator app in order to meet this requirement and add the associated claims from their account. 

**Verifiable Credentials:** The end result of an issuance flow is to produce a Verifiable Credential but you may also ask the user to Present a Verifiable Credential in order to issue one. The Rules File is able to take specific claims from the presented Verifiable Credential and include those claims in the newly issued Verifiable Credential from your organization. 

**Self Issued Claims:** When this option is selected, the user will be able to directly type information into Authenticator. At this time, strings are the only supported input for self issued claims. 

**Static Claims:** Additionally we are able declare a static claim in the Rules file, however this input does not come from the user. The Issuer defines a static claim in the Rules file and would look like any other claim in the Verifiable Credential. Simply add a credentialSubject after vc.type and declare the attribute and the claim. 

```json
"vc": {
    "type": [ "StaticClaimCredential" ],
    "credentialSubject": {
      "staticClaim": true
    },
  }
}
```


## Input Type: ID Token

```json
    {
      "attestations": {
        "idTokens": [
          {
            "mapping": {
              "firstName": { "claim": "given_name" },
              "lastName": { "claim": "family_name" }
            },
            "configuration": "https://dIdPlayground.b2clogin.com/dIdPlayground.onmicrosoft.com/B2C_1_sisu/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration",
            "client_id": "8d5b446e-22b2-4e01-bb2e-9070f6b20c90",
            "redirect_uri": "vcclient://openid/",
            "scope": "openid profile"
          }
        ]
      },
      "validityInterval": 2592000,
      "vc": {
        "type": ["https://schema.org/EducationalCredential", "https://schemas.ed.gov/universityDiploma2020", "https://schemas.contoso.edu/diploma2020" ]
      }
    }
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `attestations.idTokens` | An array of OpenID Connect identity providers that are supported for sourcing user information. |
| `...mapping` | An object that describes how claims in each ID token are mapped to attributes in the resulting Verifiable Credential. |
| `...mapping.{attribute-name}` | The attribute that should be populated in the resulting Verifiable Credential. |
| `...mapping.{attribute-name}.claim` | The claim in ID tokens whose value should be used to populate the attribute. |
| `...configuration` | The location of your identity provider's configuration document. This URL must adhere to the [OpenID Connect standard for identity provider metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata). The configuration document must include the `issuer`, `authorization_endpoint`, `token_endpoint`, and `jwks_uri` fields. |
| `...client_id` | The client ID obtained during the client registration process. |
| `...scope` | A space delimited list of scopes the IDP needs to be able to return the correct claims in the ID token. |
| `...redirect_uri` | Must always use the value `vcclient://openid/`. |
| `validityInterval` | A time duration, in seconds, representing the lifetime of your Verifiable Credentials. After this time period elapses, the Verifiable Credential will no longer be valid. Omitting this value means that each Verifiable Credential will remain valid until is it explicitly revoked. |
| `vc.type` | An array of strings indicating the schema(s) that your Verifiable Credential satisfies. See the section below. |

## Choose credential type(s) 

All Verifiable Credentials must declare their "type" in their rules file. The type of a credential distinguishes your Verifiable Credentials from credentials issued by other organizations and ensures interoperability between issuers and verifiers. To indicate a credential type, you must provide one or more credential types that the credential satisfies. Each type is represented by a unique string - often a URI will be used to ensure global uniqueness. The URI does not need to be addressable; it is treated as a string. 

As an example, a diploma credential issued by Contoso University might declare the following types:

| Type | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `https://schema.org/EducationalCredential` | Declares that diplomas issued by Contoso University contain attributes defined by schema.org's `EducationaCredential` object. |
| `https://schemas.ed.gov/universityDiploma2020` | Declares that diplomas issued by Contoso University contain attributes defined by the United States department of education. |
| `https://schemas.contoso.edu/diploma2020` | Declares that diplomas issued by Contoso University contain attributes defined by Contoso University. |

By declaring all three types, Contoso University's diplomas can be used to satisfy different requests from verifiers. A bank can request a set of `EducationCredential`s from a user, and the diploma can be used to satisfy the request. But the Contoso University Alumni Association can request a credential of type `https://schemas.contoso.edu/diploma2020`, and the diploma will also satisfy the request.

To ensure interoperability of your credentials, it's recommended that you work closely with related organizations to define credential types, schemas, and URIs for use in your industry. Many industry bodies provide guidance on the structure of official documents that can be repurposed for defining the contents of Verifiable Credentials. You should also work closely with the verifiers of your credentials to understand how they intend to request and consume your Verifiable Credentials.

## Input Type: Verifiable Credential

## Display File: Verifiable Credentials in Microsoft Authenticator

Verifiable Credentials offer a limited set of options that can be used to reflect your brand. This article provides instructions how to customize your credentials, and best practices for designing credentials that look great once issued to users.

Verifiable Credentials issued to users are displayed as cards in Microsoft Authenticator. As the administrator, you may choose card color, icon, and text strings to match your organization's brand.

![card example](media/credential-design/authenticator-card-display.png)

Cards also contain customizable fields that you can use to let users know the purpose of the card, the attributes it contains, and more.

## Create a credential display file

Much like the rules file, the display file is a simple JSON file that describes how the contents of your Verifiable Credentials should be displayed in the Microsoft Authenticator app. 

>[!NOTE]
> At this time, this display model is only used by Microsoft Authenticator.

The display file has the following structure.

```json
{
    "default": {
      "locale": "en-US",
      "card": {
        "title": "University Graduate",
        "issuedBy": "Contoso University",
        "backgroundColor": "#212121",
        "textColor": "#FFFFFF",
        "logo": {
          "uri": "https://contoso.edu/images/logo.png",
          "description": "Contoso University Logo"
        },
        "description": "This digital diploma is issued to students and alumni of Contoso University."
      },
      "consent": {
        "title": "Do you want to get your digital diploma from Contoso U?",
        "instructions": "Please log in with your Contoso U account to receive your digital diploma."
      },
      "claims": {
        "vc.credentialSubject.name": {
          "type": "String",
          "label": "Name"
        }
      }
    }
}
```
