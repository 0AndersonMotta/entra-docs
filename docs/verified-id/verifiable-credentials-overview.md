What is a DID?

"decentralized identifier = A portable URL-based identifier, also known as a DID, associated with an entity. These identifiers are most often used in a verifiable credential and are associated with subjects such that a verifiable credential itself can be easily ported from one repository to another without the need to reissue the credential. An example of a DID is did:example:123456abcdef." From https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#:~:text=A%20portable%20URL%2Dbased%20identifier,need%20to%20reissue%20the%20credential.
