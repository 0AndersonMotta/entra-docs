# Tutorial: Enable password synchronization in Azure Active Directory Domain Services for hybrid environments

For hybrid environments, an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant can be configured to synchronize with an on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment using Azure AD Connect. By default, Azure AD Connect doesn't synchronize legacy NTLM and Kerberos credential hashes to Azure AD.

To use Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) with accounts synchronized from an on-premises AD DS environment, you need to configure Azure AD Connect to synchronize the password hashes required for NTLM and Kerberos authentication. You don't need to perform these steps if you use cloud-only accounts and don't have an on-premises AD DS environment.

In this tutorial, you learn:

> * How to configure legacy password hash synchronization for Azure AD Connect

If you don’t have an Azure subscription, [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following resources:

* An active Azure subscription.
    * If you don’t have an Azure subscription, [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* An Azure Active Directory tenant associated with your subscription that's synchronized with an on-premises directory using Azure AD Connect.
    * If needed, [create an Azure Active Directory tenant][create-azure-ad-tenant] or [associate an Azure subscription with your account][associate-azure-ad-tenant].
    * If needed, [enable Azure AD Connect for password hash synchronization][enable-azure-ad-connect].
* An Azure Active Directory Domain Services managed domain enabled and configured in your Azure AD tenant.
    * If needed, [create and configure an Azure Active Directory Domain Services instance][create-azure-ad-ds-instance].
* A user account that's a member of the *Azure AD DC administrators* group in your Azure AD tenant.

## Password hash synchronization using Azure AD Connect

Azure AD Connect is used to synchronize objects like user accounts and groups from an on-premises AD DS environment into an Azure AD tenant. As part of the process, password hash synchronization enables accounts to use the same password in the on-prem AD DS environment and Azure AD.

To authenticate users on the managed domain, Azure AD DS needs password hashes in a format that's suitable for NT LAN Manager (NTLM) and Kerberos authentication. Azure AD doesn't generate or store password hashes in the format that's required for NTLM or Kerberos authentication until you enable Azure AD DS for your tenant. For security reasons, Azure AD also doesn't store any password credentials in clear-text form. Therefore, Azure AD can't automatically generate these NTLM or Kerberos password hashes based on users' existing credentials.

As prerequisite to configuring Azure AD Connect to generate the required NTLM or Kerberos password hashes for Azure AD DS, you need to first [enable Azure AD Connect for password hash synchronization][enable-azure-ad-connect]. Make sure that you [download and install the latest available release of Azure AD Connect][azure-ad-connect-download].

If you have an existing instance of Azure AD Connect, update to the latest version to make sure you can generate the legacy password hashes for NTLM and Kerberos. This functionality isn't available in early releases of Azure AD Connect or with the legacy DirSync tool. Azure AD Connect version *1.1.614.0* or later is required.

## Enable synchronization of password hashes

With Azure AD Connect installed and configured to synchronize with Azure AD, now configure the legacy password hash sync for NTLM and Kerberos.

1. On the computer with Azure AD Connect installed, from the Start menu, open the Azure AD Connect > Synchronization Service.
1. Select the **Connectors** tab. The connection information used to establish the synchronization between the on-premises AD DS environment and Azure AD are listed.

    The **Type** indicates either *Windows Azure Active Directory (Microsoft)* for the Azure AD connector or *Active Directory Domain Services* for the on-premises connector. Make a note of the connector names to use in PowerShell script in the next step.

    In the following example screenshot, the Azure AD connector is named *contoso.onmicrosoft.com - AAD* and the on-premises connector is named *onprem.contoso.com*

    ![List the connector names in Sync Service Manager](media/tutorial-configure-password-hash-sync/service-sync-manager.png)

1. Copy and paste the following PowerShell script to the computer with Azure AD Connect installed. Update the `$azureadConnector` and `$adConnector` variables with the connector names from the previous step. Run this script on each AD forest to synchronize on-premises account NTLM and Kerberos password hashes to Azure AD. The script also initiates a full synchronization of Azure AD Connect to Azure AD:

    ```powershell
    $azureadConnector = "<CASE SENSITIVE AZURE AD CONNECTOR NAME>"
    $adConnector = "<CASE SENSITIVE AD DS CONNECTOR NAME>"
    Import-Module adsync
    $c = Get-ADSyncConnector -Name $adConnector
    $p = New-Object Microsoft.IdentityManagement.PowerShell.ObjectModel.ConfigurationParameter "Microsoft.Synchronize.ForceFullPasswordSync", String, ConnectorGlobal, $null, $null, $null
    $p.Value = 1
    $c.GlobalParameters.Remove($p.Name)
    $c.GlobalParameters.Add($p)
    $c = Add-ADSyncConnector -Connector $c
    Set-ADSyncAADPasswordSyncConfiguration -SourceConnector $adConnector -TargetConnector $azureadConnector -Enable $false
    Set-ADSyncAADPasswordSyncConfiguration -SourceConnector $adConnector -TargetConnector $azureadConnector -Enable $true
    ```

    Depending on the size of your directory in terms of number of accounts and groups, synchronization of the legacy password hashes to Azure AD may take some time. The passwords are then synchronized to the Azure AD DS managed domain after they've synchronized to Azure AD.
