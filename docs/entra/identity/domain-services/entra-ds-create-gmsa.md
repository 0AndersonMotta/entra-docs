# Create a group managed service account (gMSA) on an Azure AD Domain Services managed domain
This article shows you how to create managed service accounts on an Azure AD Domain Services managed domain.

## Managed Service Accounts
A standalone Managed Service Account (sMSA) is a managed domain account that provides automatic password management, simplified service principal name (SPN) management, and the ability to delegate the management to other administrators. This type of managed service account (MSA) was introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7.

The group Managed Service Account (gMSA) provides the same functionality within the domain for many servers. All instances of a service hosted on a server farm (for example, a network load balancer) must use the same service principal for mutual authentication protocols to work. When a gMSA is used as service principal, the Windows operating system manages the account's password instead of relying on the administrator.

## Using service accounts in Azure AD Domain services
Azure AD Domain Services managed domains are locked down and managed by Microsoft. There are a couple of key considerations when using service accounts with Azure AD Domain Services.

### Create service accounts within custom organizational units (OU) on the managed domain
You cannot create a service account in the built-in 'AADDC Users' or 'AADDC Computers' organizational units. [Create a custom OU](active-directory-ds-admin-guide-create-ou.md) on your managed domain and then create service accounts within that custom OU.

### The Key Distribution Services (KDS) root key is already pre-created
The Key Distribution Services (KDS) root key is pre-created on an Azure AD Domain Services managed domain. You do not need to create a KDS root key and do not have privileges to do so either. You cannot view the KDS root key on the managed domain either.
