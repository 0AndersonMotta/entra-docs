# Configure Azure Active Directory for CMMC compliance

Azure Active Directory provides the capability to meet all identity related practice requirements within each of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) levels. It's the responsibility of companies performing work with, and on behalf of, the US Dept. of Defense (DoD) to complete additional configurations or processes to be compliant with requirements in CMMC.
Within CMMC Level 1, there are three domains that have one or more practices related to identity. The three domains are:

* Access Control (AC)

* Identification and Authentication (IA)

* System and Information integrity (SI)

Within CMMC Level 2, there are 13 domains that have one or more practices related to identity. The domains are:

* Access Control (AC)

* Audit & Accountability (AU)

* Configuration Management (CM)

* Identification & Authentication (IA)

* Incident Response (IR)

* Maintenance (MA)

* Media Protection (MP)

* Personnel Security (PS)

* Physical Protection (PE)

* Risk Assessment (RA)

* Security Assessment (CA)

* System and Communications Protection (SC)

* System and Information Integrity (SI)

The remainder of the articles in this series provide guidance and links to additional resources organized by level and domain. For each domain, there's a table with the relevant controls listed and links to content that provides step-by-step guidance to accomplish the practice.
