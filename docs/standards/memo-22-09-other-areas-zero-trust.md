# Other areas of zero trust addressed in Memo 22-09

While this guidance set is meant to address the identity specific actions of the memorandum, there are other areas of the zero trust maturity model that cover topics beyond the identity pillar. 

The scope of the following sections is to give guidance on the following cross-cutting themes:

* Visibility and analytics

* Automation and orchestration

* Governance 

## Visibility

Monitoring Azure AD is important to adopt an assume breach mindset and meet compliance standards set forth in M-22-09 and M-21-31. There are three primary log types used for security analysis and ingestion:

1. [Azure Audit Log-](../reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs.md) Used to monitor operational activities of the directory itself such as creating, deleting, updating objects like users or groups, as well as making changes to configurations of Azure AD like modifications to a conditional access policy.

2. [Azure AD Sign-In Logs-](../reports-monitoring/concept-all-sign-ins.md) Used to monitor all sign-in activities associated with users, applications, and service principals. The sign-in logs contain specific categories of sign-ins for easy distinctions between them:

   1. Interactive sign-ins: Shows user sign-ins for failures, successes, as well as policies that may have been applied and other relevant metadata.

   1. Non-interactive user sign-ins: Shows sign-ins where a user did not perform an interaction during sign-in, typically clients signing in on behalf of the user such as mobile applications or email clients.

   1. Service principal sign-ins: Sign-ins by service principals or applications, typically these are headless and done by services or applications accessing other services, applications or Azure AD directory itself through REST API.

   1. Managed identities for azure resource sign-ins: These are sign-ins from resources where Azure Managed identities were created. Typically these are Azure resources or applications that are accessing other Azure resources such as a web application service authenticating to a Azure SQL backend. 

1. [Provisioning Logs-](../reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs.md) These logs contain information about objects synchronized from Azure AD using SCIM to applications like Service Now. 

These logs are stored for 7 days for Azure AD free tenants. Tenants that contain an Azure AD premium license will retain these logs for 30 days. Itâ€™s important to ensure these logs are ingested by a SIEM tool alongside other telemetry. This will allow these sign-in and audit events to be correlated with application, infrastructure, data, device and, network logs for a holistic approach. Microsoft recommends integrating your Azure AD logs with [Sentinel](../../sentinel/overview.md). This is done by configuring a connector to ingest your Azure AD tenant Logs more information [here](../../sentinel/connect-azure-active-directory.md). If your organization uses another SIEM tool you can also configure the [diagnostic settings](../reports-monitoring/overview-monitoring.md) on your Azure AD tenant to send the data to either a Storage account, EventHub, or Log analytics workspace. These options allow you to integrate your 3<sup data-htmlnode="">rd</sup> party SIEM tools to collect the data from these storage types. For more information, see [Plan reports & monitoring deploymen](../reports-monitoring/plan-monitoring-and-reporting.md)t.

 

## Analytics

Analytics can be used to aggregate information from Azure AD about trends or your security posture in comparison to your baseline. Analytics can also be used as the way to assess and look for patterns or threats across Azure AD. There are a few areas where analysis for security and information can be utilized:

* [Azure AD Identity Protection-](../identity-protection/overview-identity-protection.md) Identity protection actively analyses sign-ins and other telemetry sources for risky behavior. This risky behavior assigns a risk score to a sign-in event and allows you to prevent sign-ins or force a step-up authentication for accessing the resource or application.

* [Microsoft Sentinel-](../../sentinel/get-visibility.md) Sentinel has many ways in which information from Azure AD can be analyzed. 

   * Microsoft Sentinel has [User and Entity Behavioral Analytics (UEBA)](../../sentinel/identify-threats-with-entity-behavior-analytics.md). Which classify much of the users and service principals used in Azure AD as user and account entities. This enhances events across the enterprise to help detect anomalous behavior amongst users and systems. 

   * Specific analytics rule templates that hunt for threats and alerts on conditions found from information in your Azure AD logs that your SOC analyst can triage and remediate.

   * Microsoft Sentinel has [workbooks](http://workbooks/) available that help visualize multiple data sources from Azure AD. These include workbooks that show conglomerate sign-ins by country or applications you have with the most sign-ins. You can also create or modify existing workbooks to view information or threats from Azure AD in a dashboard to gain insights. 

* [Azure AD usage and insights report-](../reports-monitoring/concept-usage-insights-report.md) These reports show information similar to sentinel workbooks like which applications have the highest usage or logon trends over a given time period. These are useful for understanding aggregate trends in your enterprise which may indicate an attack or other events. 

## Automation and orchestration

Automation is an important aspect of Zero Trust particularly in remediation of alerts that may occur because of threats or posture changes in your environment. This section will focus on automation integrations that are possible with Azure AD to remediate alerts or perform actions that may improve your overall security posture because of information received from monitoring and analytics. Azure AD uses the [Microsoft Graph API](../develop/microsoft-graph-intro.md) as the most common way to programmatically access Azure AD using REST API calls. This API based access requires an Azure AD Identity to authenticate and perform these actions in addition to the necessary authorizations and scope. Microsoft recommends an Azure function or Azure Logic App to be setup to use a [System Assigned Managed Identity](../managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md) where your logic app or function contains the steps or code necessary to carry out the action in an automated fashion. You can assign permissions to the Managed identity to grant the service principal the necessary directory permissions to perform the actions required. Ensure that you follow a least privileged model when granting these identities access to Azure AD by only granting the minimum rights necessary. With the Graph API third party tool integration is also possible. Consider following similar principles outlined above when performing this integration. Another automation integration point is [Azure AD PowerShell](../overview.md?view=azureadps-2.0) modules. This is useful for administrators and IT integrators to perform common tasks or configurations against Azure AD in an automated fashion. This can also be incorporated into Azure functions or Azure automation runbooks to perform these activities. 

## Governance

Azure AD has several features which allow for governance like functionality to be applied to areas within Azure AD. These technical controls however are no substitute for clear processes and understanding of how you intend to operate your Azure AD environment. Consider the following guidance to help with governance around Azure AD [Azure Active Directory governance operations reference guide | Microsoft Docs](../fundamentals/active-directory-ops-guide-govern.md). Security operational guidance for Azure AD is also available to aid in understanding governance and SecOps overlap [Azure Active Directory security operations guide | Microsoft Docs](../fundamentals/security-operations-introduction.md). Once a operational governance is understood various features can be leveraged for implementing portions of your governance controls. These include features under [Azure AD Identity Governance](../governance/identity-governance-overview.md) mentioned in [RBAC](#_RBAC).
