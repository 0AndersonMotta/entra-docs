# Create a remote network using Azure vWAN

In this article, we'll explain how to simulate remote network connectivity using a remote virtual wide-area network (vWAN). If you want to simulate remote network connectivity using an Azure virtual network gateway, see the article, [Create a remote network using Azure virtual networks](/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-simulate-remote-network).

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this process, you must have the following prerequisites in place:
- An Azure subscription and permission to create resources in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
- A basic understanding of virtual wide area networks (vWAN).
- A basic understanding of [site-to-site VPN connections](/azure/vpn-gateway/tutorial-site-to-site-portal).
- A Microsoft Entra tenant with the [Global Secure Access Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-secure-access-administrator) role assigned.
- A basic understanding of Azure virtual desktops or Azure virtual machines.

In this document, we use the following default values. Feel free to configure these settings according to your own requirements.
- Subscription: Visual Studio Enterprise
- Resource group name: GlobalSecureAccess_Documentation
- Region: South Central US

## Set up a virtual WAN in the Azure portal
To set up a virtual WAN, you'll need to complete three sub-steps: create a virtual WAN, create a virtual hub with a site-to-site virtual private network (VPN) gateway, and obtain the VPN gateway information.

### Create a virtual WAN
Create a virtual wide area network to connect to your resources in Azure. For more information about Virtual WAN, see the [Virtual WAN Overview](/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-about).
1.	From the Microsoft Azure portal, in the **Search resources** bar, type **Virtual WAN** in the search box and select **Enter**.
1.	Select **Virtual WANs** from the results. On the Virtual WANs page, select **+ Create** to open the **Create WAN** page.
1.	On the **Create WAN** page, on the **Basics** tab, fill in the fields. Modify the example values to apply to your environment.
    - **Subscription**: Select the subscription that you want to use.
    - **Resource group**: Create new or use existing.
    - **Resource group location**: Choose a resource location from the dropdown. A WAN is a global resource and doesn't live in a particular region. However, you must select a region to manage and locate the WAN resource that you create.
    - **Name**: Type the Name that you want to call your virtual WAN.
    - **Type**: Basic or Standard. Select **Standard**. If you select Basic, understand that Basic virtual WANs can only contain Basic hubs. Basic hubs can only be used for site-to-site connections.
1.	After filling out the fields, at the bottom of the page, select **Review + create**.

1.	Once validation passes, click **Create** to create the virtual WAN.

### Create a virtual hub with a VPN gateway
Next, create a virtual hub with a site-to-site virtual private network (VPN) gateway:
1.	Within the new vWAN, under **Connectivity**, select **Hubs**.
1.	Select **+ New Hub**.
1.	On the **Create virtual hub** page, on the **Basics** tab, fill in the fields according to your environment.
    - **Region**: Select the region in which you want to deploy the virtual hub.
    - **Name**: The name by which you want the virtual hub to be known.
    - **Hub private address space**: The hub's address range in CIDR notation. The minimum address space is /24 to create a hub.
    - **Virtual hub capacity**: Select from the dropdown. For more information, see [Virtual hub settings](/azure/virtual-wan/hub-settings).
    - **Hub routing preference**: Leave as default. For more information, see [Virtual hub routing preference](/azure/virtual-wan/about-virtual-hub-routing-preference).
:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-remote-network-vwan/vwan-create-new-hub-basics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create virtual hub page, on the Basics tab, with completed fields." lightbox="media/how-to-create-remote-network-vwan/vwan-create-new-hub-basics-expanded.png"::: 

1.	Proceed to the **Site to site** tab and complete the following fields:
    - Select **Yes** to create a Site-to-site (VPN gateway).
    - **AS Number**: The AS Number field can't be edited.
    - **Gateway scale units**: Select the value to align with the aggregate throughput of the VPN gateway being created in the virtual hub.
    - **Routing preference**: Choose how your traffic routes between Azure and the internet. For more information about routing preference via Microsoft network or ISP, see the [Routing preference](/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/routing-preference-overview) article.
