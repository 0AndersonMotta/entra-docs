# Create a remote network using Azure vWAN

In this article, we'll explain how to simulate remote network connectivity using a remote virtual wide-area network (vWAN). If you want to simulate remote network connectivity using an Azure virtual network gateway, see the article, [Create a remote network using Azure virtual networks](/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-simulate-remote-network).

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this process, you must have the following prerequisites in place:
- An Azure subscription and permission to create resources in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
- A basic understanding of virtual wide area networks (vWAN).
- A basic understanding of [site-to-site VPN connections](/azure/vpn-gateway/tutorial-site-to-site-portal).
- A Microsoft Entra tenant with the [Global Secure Access Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-secure-access-administrator) role assigned.
- A basic understanding of Azure virtual desktops or Azure virtual machines.

In this document, we use the following default values. Feel free to configure these settings according to your own requirements.
- Subscription: Visual Studio Enterprise
- Resource group name: GlobalSecureAccess_Documentation
- Region: South Central US

## Set up a virtual WAN in the Azure portal
To set up a virtual WAN, you'll need to complete three sub-steps: create a virtual WAN, create a virtual hub with a site-to-site virtual private network (VPN) gateway, and obtain the VPN gateway information.

### Create a virtual WAN
Create a virtual wide area network to connect to your resources in Azure. For more information about Virtual WAN, see the [Virtual WAN Overview](/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-about).
1.	From the Microsoft Azure portal, in the **Search resources** bar, type **Virtual WAN** in the search box and select **Enter**.
1.	Select **Virtual WANs** from the results. On the Virtual WANs page, select **+ Create** to open the **Create WAN** page.
1.	On the **Create WAN** page, on the **Basics** tab, fill in the fields. Modify the example values to apply to your environment.
    - **Subscription**: Select the subscription that you want to use.
    - **Resource group**: Create new or use existing.
    - **Resource group location**: Choose a resource location from the dropdown. A WAN is a global resource and doesn't live in a particular region. However, you must select a region to manage and locate the WAN resource that you create.
    - **Name**: Type the Name that you want to call your virtual WAN.
    - **Type**: Basic or Standard. Select **Standard**. If you select Basic, understand that Basic virtual WANs can only contain Basic hubs. Basic hubs can only be used for site-to-site connections.
1.	After filling out the fields, at the bottom of the page, select **Review + create**.

1.	Once validation passes, click **Create** to create the virtual WAN.

### Create a virtual hub with a VPN gateway
Next, create a virtual hub with a site-to-site virtual private network (VPN) gateway:
1.	Within the new vWAN, under **Connectivity**, select **Hubs**.
1.	Select **+ New Hub**.
1.	On the **Create virtual hub** page, on the **Basics** tab, fill in the fields according to your environment.
    - **Region**: Select the region in which you want to deploy the virtual hub.
    - **Name**: The name by which you want the virtual hub to be known.
    - **Hub private address space**: The hub's address range in CIDR notation. The minimum address space is /24 to create a hub.
    - **Virtual hub capacity**: Select from the dropdown. For more information, see [Virtual hub settings](/azure/virtual-wan/hub-settings).
    - **Hub routing preference**: Leave as default. For more information, see [Virtual hub routing preference](/azure/virtual-wan/about-virtual-hub-routing-preference).
:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-remote-network-vwan/vwan-create-new-hub-basics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create virtual hub page, on the Basics tab, with completed fields." lightbox="media/how-to-create-remote-network-vwan/vwan-create-new-hub-basics-expanded.png"::: 

1.	Proceed to the **Site to site** tab and complete the following fields:
    - Select **Yes** to create a Site-to-site (VPN gateway).
    - **AS Number**: The AS Number field can't be edited.
    - **Gateway scale units**: Select the value to align with the aggregate throughput of the VPN gateway being created in the virtual hub.
    - **Routing preference**: Choose how your traffic routes between Azure and the internet. For more information about routing preference via Microsoft network or ISP, see the [Routing preference](/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/routing-preference-overview) article.

1. Leave the remaining tab options set to their defaults and select **Review + create** to validate.
1. Select **Create** to create the hub and gateway. *This can take up to 30 minutes*. 
1. After 30 minutes, **Refresh** to view the hub on the **Hubs** page, and then select **Go to resource** to navigate to the resource.

### Obtain VPN gateway information
To create a remote network in the Microsoft Entra admin center, youâ€™ll need to view and record the VPN gateway information for the virtual hub you created in the previous step.
1.	Within the new vWAN, under **Connectivity**, select **Hubs**.
1.	Select the virtual hub.
1.	Select **VPN (Site to site)**.
1.	On the Virtual Hub page, select the **VPN Gateway** link.

1. On the VPN Gateway page, select **JSON View**.
1. Copy the JSON text into a file for reference in upcoming steps. Make note of the **autonomous system number (ASN)**, device **IP address**, and the device **border gateway protocol (BGP) address** to use in the Entra admin center in next step.

> [!TIP]
> You cannot change the ASN value. 

## Create a remote network in the Microsoft Entra admin center
In this step, use the network information from the VPN gateway to create a remote network in the Microsoft Entra admin center. The first step is to provide the name and location of your remote network. This tab is required.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as a [Global Secure Access Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-secure-access-administrator).
1. Navigate to **Global Secure Access (preview)** > **Connect** > **Remote networks**.
1. Select the **Create remote network** button and provide the details.
    - **Name**
    - **Region**
1. Proceed to the **Connectivity** tab, where you add the device links for the remote network.
1. Click **+ Add a link**.
1. Complete the fields on the the **General** tab in the **Add a link** form, using the VPN gateway's *Instance0* configuration from the previous step:
    - **Link name**: Name of your Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).
    - **Device type**: Choose a device option from the dropdown list.
    - **IP address**: Public IP address of your device.
    - **Local BGP address**: Enter a BGP IP address that *isn't* part of your on-premises network where your CPE resides.
    - **Peer BGP address**: Enter the BGP IP address of your CPE.
    - **Link ASN**: Provide the autonomous system number (ASN) of the CPE.
    - **Redundancy**: Select either *No redundancy* or *Zone redundancy* for your IPSec tunnel.
    - **Zone redundant local BGP address**: This optional field shows up only when you select **Zone redundancy**.
        - Enter a BGP IP address that isn't* part of your on-premises network where your CPE resides and is different from the **Local BGP address**.
    - **Bandwidth capacity (Mbps)**: Specify tunnel bandwidth. Available options are 250, 500, 750, and 1,000 Mbps.

For more information about links, see the article, [How to manage remote network device links](how-to-manage-remote-network-device-links.md).

1. Select the **Next** button to view the **Details** tab. Keep the default settings.
1. Select the **Next** button to view the **Security** tab. 
1. Enter the **Preshared key (PSK)**. The same secret key must be used on your CPE.
1. Select the **Save** button.

Repeat the above steps to create a second device link with VPN gateway's *Instance1* configuration. 

1. Proceed to the **Traffic profiles** tab to select the traffic profile to link to the remote network. 
1. Select **Microsoft 365 traffic profile**.
