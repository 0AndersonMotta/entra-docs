# Learn how to deploy on premises connectors for Global Secure Access
Application Proxy is used for on premises access for web applications. To learn more about Application Proxy, see [Using Azure AD Application Proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users](../active-directory/app-proxy/what-is-application-proxy.md).


## Understand Application Proxy connectors
Connectors are what make Application Proxy possible. They're simple, easy to deploy and maintain, and super powerful. This article discusses what connectors are, how they work, and some suggestions for how to optimize your deployment. To learn more about connectors, see [Understand Azure AD Application Proxy connectors](../active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-connectors.md).

## Publish applications on separate networks and locations using connector groups
You can create Application Proxy connector groups so that you can assign specific connectors to serve specific applications. This capability gives you more control and ways to optimize your Application Proxy deployment. To learn more about connector groups, see [Publish applications on separate networks and locations using connector groups](../active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-connector-groups.md).
