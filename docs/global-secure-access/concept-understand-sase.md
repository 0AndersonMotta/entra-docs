# Understand Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph 
Required. Lead with a light intro that describes what the article covers. Answer the 
fundamental “why would I want to know this?” question. Keep it short.

A local network has been around for ages.
A local network is put together and managed by network administrators.
The local network provides tight control and visibility.
Network traffic can be destined for local software on local servers or to software out on the Internet.
Network traffic destined for the Internet could still be viewed and controlled since the originating computer is on the local network.
The problem now is that people are not in a physical location and connecting to a local network.
People are out in the world, remote, and connecting to the Internet through any number of ways such as cell service, home Internet, or public hot spots.
Zero Trust Network Access provides a mechanism to maintain control and visibility when devices are connecting through unknown Internet connections. 

Existing offerings, see [Azure Networking Services]( ../networking/fundamentals/networking-overview.md ).

Looking at the existing services, there is a section on “Virtual network” that discusses setting up the virtual networks communication to the Internet. There is also a section on “VPN Gateway feature for individual devices” that describes how to setup individual computers to access the virtual network. Then there is “Azure Firewall” that could be used to set policies and filter traffic out to the Internet. If my understanding is correct, then stitching these current offerings together would provide similar functionality to ZTNA and what our new service is doing is making things easier for customers to achieve the “Internet first” strategy and maintain control and visibility.
