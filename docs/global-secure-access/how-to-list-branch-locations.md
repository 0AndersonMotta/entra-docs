# Learn how to list all branch office locations for Global Secure Access

Learn how to list all branch office locations for Global Secure Access.

## Pre-requisites 
- Global Secure Access license for your Microsoft Entra Identity tenant.  
- Entra Network Access Administrator role in Microsoft Entra Identity.
- Microsoft Graph module when using PowerShell.
- Admin consent when using Graph explorer for Microsoft Graph API. 

## List all branch locations
List all branch locations in your tenant.

### List all branches using the Microsoft Entra admin center
1. Navigate to the Microsoft Entra admin center at [https://entra.microsoft.com](https://entra.microsoft.com) and login with administrator credentials.
1. In the left hand navigation choose **Global Secure Access**. 
1. Select **Connect** in the left-hand side navigation menu. 
1. Select **Branch**.

### List all branches using the Microsoft Graph API 
1. Sign in to the [Graph Explorer](https://aka.ms/ge). 
1. Select GET as the HTTP method from the dropdown. 
1. Select the API version to beta. 
1. Add the query to use List Branches API (add hyperlink to the Graph API) 
    ```
    GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/networkaccess/branches 
    ```
1. Select **Run query** to list the branches.  

## Known issues

### Custom IPsec policy will not work properly if salifetimeinseconds is lower than 300 
* Validations are not happening at the control plane, so you may get an HTTP status response 200 / OK but it doesn’t mean it will work. 
* Ensure your `salifetimeinseconds` setting is higher than 300. 
* If the tunnel is not working within 2-5 minutes, delete your branch and recreate the device link using a `Default IPsec` policy.

### API GET for forwarding profiles works at a tenant level but doesn’t work at branch level 
* This works: `GET https://canary.graph.microsoft.com/testprodbetaZTNA-UI-integration/networkaccess/forwardingProfiles`
* This does not work: `GET https://canary.graph.microsoft.com/testprodbetaZTNA-UI-integration/networkaccess/branches/72647a2c-d264-4469-a0fb-ab8d99b33bd2/forwardingProfiles`
