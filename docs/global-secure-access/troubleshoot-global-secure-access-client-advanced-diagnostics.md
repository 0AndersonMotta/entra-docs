# Troubleshoot the Global Secure Access client with advanced diagnostics
This document provides troubleshooting guidance for the Global Secure Access client using the advanced diagnostics utility.

## Introduction
The Global Secure Access client runs in the background and routes relevant network traffic to Global Secure Access. It does not require user interaction. The advanced diagnostics tool makes the client's behavior visible to the administrator and helps in troubleshooting.

## Launch the advanced diagnostics tool
To launch the advanced diagnostics tool:
1. Right-click on the Global Secure Access client icon in the system tray.
1. Select **Advanced Diagnostics**.
If enabled, UAC (User Account Control) will prompt for elevation of privileges.
