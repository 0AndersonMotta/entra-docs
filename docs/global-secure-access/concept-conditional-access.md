# Global Secure Access and Conditional Access

Global Secure Access enlightens Conditional Access in multiple ways to help organizations improve their security posture and adopt Zero Trust principles. The underlying Conditional Access feature does not change with the following additions, the polies are processed in the same way. Functionalitiy like continuous access evaluation and more benefit from these additional enhancements to visibility in traffic coming from Global Secure Access clients or configured branch offices.

## Source IP restoration

With a cloud based network proxy between users and their resources, the source IP address that the resources see doesn't always match the actual source IP. In place of the end-usersâ€™ source IP, the resource endpoints typically see the cloud proxy as the source IP. Customers that use IP-based location information as a control in Conditional Access typically have issues with traditional SASE solutions breaking this capability. Source IP restoration allows Conditional Access and other downstream applications to continue to use the source IP address in decision making. IP location-based checks are used in places like: [continuous access evaluation](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation), [Identity Protection risk detections](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks), [audit logs](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins), and [endpoint detection & response (EDR)](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/overview-endpoint-detection-response).

To enable source IP restoration see the article, [Enabling source IP restoration](how-to-source-ip-restoration.md).

## Conditional Access on network traffic profiles

Integrations with the new Global Secure Access client and configured branch offices allow profiling of network traffic from endpoints as a way to consistently enforce policy. This functionality surfaces in Conditional Access as a new assignment that policies can target called traffic profiles.

## Conditional Access on compliant network

Network traffic coming from Global Secure Access clients or configured branch offices to resources can be identified in Conditional Access policies. This ability is surfaced as a location condition called **All Compliant Network locations**. This location is used in the same way IP ranges or countries would, without the overhead of updating and redefining individual ranges. This location can be included or excluded in Conditional Access policies to meet organizational requirements. [Branch office networks](NEED-LINK-TO-DOC) and endpoints running the [Global Secure Access client]((how-to-install-windows-client.md)) appear in this location.

For example, you may only want users to access certain sensitive applications that don't support modern authentication when they are on this compliant network.

These compliant network locations are specific to each tenant. Branch locations or clients for one organization do not appear in another's.
