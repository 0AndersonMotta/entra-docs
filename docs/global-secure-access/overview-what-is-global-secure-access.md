# What is Global Secure Access?

A new category of computing has emerged as the modern workforce has moved to working both inside and outside of traditional offices. Gartner calls this new category Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) and Forrester divides the concept further with a term called Security Service Edge (SSE). 

In general, you can think of these categories as a Network as a Service (NaaS) or an extension of a traditional corporate network. The idea being that the network your organization controls and monitors is extended down to individual devices and users regardless of whether they are working in a traditional office or a coffee shop on the other side of the world. The diagrams show the traditional line of control and the modern line of control for network traffic.
