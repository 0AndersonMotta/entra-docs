# What is Global Secure Access?

The way people work has changed. Instead of working in traditional offices, people now work from nearly anywhere. With applications and data moving to the cloud, an identity-aware, cloud-delivered network perimeter for the modern workforce is needed. This new network security category is called Security Service Edge (SSE).

Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access comprise Microsoft's Security Service Edge solution, coupled with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, our SaaS-security focused Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB). Global Secure Access is the unifying term used for both Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access. Global Secure Access is the unified location in Microsoft Entra and is built upon the core principles of Zero Trust to use least privilege, verify explicitly, and assume breach. 

Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access are uniquely built as a solution that converges network, identity, and endpoint access controls so you can secure access to any app or resource, from anywhere. With the addition of these Global Secure Access products, Microsoft Entra simplifies access policy management and enables access orchestration for employees, business partners, and digital workloads. You can continuously monitor and adjust user access in real time if permissions or risk level changes.

The Global Secure Access features streamline the roll-out and management of the access control capabilities with a unified portal. These features are delivered from one of the largest global private networks, spanning 140+ countries and 190+ network edge locations, enabling organizations to optimally connect users and devices to public and private resources seamlessly and securely.

## Microsoft Entra Private Access

Microsoft Entra Private Access provides your users - whether in an office or working remotely - secured access to your private, corporate resources. Microsoft Entra Private Access builds on the capabilities of Microsoft Entra ID App Proxy and extends access to any private resource, port, and protocol.

Remote users can connect to private apps across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, private networks, and data centers from any device and network without. The service offers per-app adaptive access based on Conditional Access policies, for more granular security than a VPN. 

### Key features
