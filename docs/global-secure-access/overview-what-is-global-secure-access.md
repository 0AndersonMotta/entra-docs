# What is Global Secure Access?

The way people work has changed. Instead of working in traditional offices, people now work from nearly anywhere. Global Secure Access provides modern network access control for users and devices.

## Understand SASE and SSE

A new category of computing has emerged as the modern workforce has moved to working both inside and outside of traditional offices. Gartner calls this new category Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) and Forrester divides the concept further with a term called Security Service Edge (SSE). Another term to describe this concept is a Network as a Service (NaaS). Microsoft calls this new area Global Secure Access.

Whatever you call it, think of the new category of networking as a solution that extends a traditional corporate network down to individual users and devices regardless of their physical location in the world. In other words, the network your organization controls and monitors is extended down to individual devices and users regardless of whether they are working in a traditional office or a coffee shop on the other side of the world. The diagrams show the traditional line of control and the modern line of control for network traffic.
