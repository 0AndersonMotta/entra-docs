## Known issues

### Custom IPsec policy will not work properly if salifetimeinseconds is lower than 300 
* Validations are not happening at the control plane, so you may get an HTTP status response 200 / OK but it doesn’t mean it will work. 
* Ensure your `salifetimeinseconds` setting is higher than 300. 
* If the tunnel is not working within 2-5 minutes, delete your branch and recreate the device link using a `Default IPsec` policy.

### API GET for forwarding profiles works at a tenant level but doesn’t work at branch level 
* This works: `GET https://canary.graph.microsoft.com/testprodbetaZTNA-UI-integration/networkaccess/forwardingProfiles`
* This does not work: `GET https://canary.graph.microsoft.com/testprodbetaZTNA-UI-integration/networkaccess/branches/72647a2c-d264-4469-a0fb-ab8d99b33bd2/forwardingProfiles`
