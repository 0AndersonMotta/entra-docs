          Does Global Secure Access allow B2B logins?
        answer: |
          At this time, B2B logins are only supported when the user is accessing the service from a device that is Azure AD joined to the tenant that matches their sign-in credentials. For example, a Contoso guest user has B2B credentials from their home tenant. To access Global Secure Access with a Contoso B2B login, the device must be Azure AD joined or hybrid Azure AD joined to Contoso.
