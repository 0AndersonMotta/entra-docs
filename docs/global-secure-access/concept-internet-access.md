# Learn about Microsoft Entra Internet Access

Microsoft Entra Internet Access provides secure access to public Internet resources.


## Web Content Filtering

Web content filtering lets you choose which types of web content users can access. By explicitly blocking known bad actor sites, you secure your users and their devices from any Internet connection whether they're remote or within a corporate network. Web content filtering makes use of Microsoft Entra Conditional Access. To learn more about Conditional Access, see [Microsoft Entra Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/).
