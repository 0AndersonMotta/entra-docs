# Learn about Quick Access for Microsoft Entra Private Access

Quick Access for Microsoft Entra Private Access unlocks the ability to specify the fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) and IP addresses that you consider private or internal, so you can manage how your organization accesses them.

By configuring Quick Access and enabling Microsoft Entra Private Access, you can modernize how your organization's users access private apps and resources. Remote workers don't need to use a VPN to access these resources if they have the Global Secure Access Client installed. The client quietly and seamlessly connects them to the resources they need.

Quick Access can be a quick and easy way to replace your VPN to allow secure access to your internal resources with an easy-one time configuration, using the secure capabilities of Conditional Access.

With Connectors, you can isolate apps per network and connector.
