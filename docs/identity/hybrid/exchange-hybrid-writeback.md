# Exchange hybrid writeback
A hybrid deployment offers organizations the ability to extend the feature-rich experience and administrative control they have with their existing on-premises Microsoft Exchange organization to the cloud. A hybrid deployment provides the seamless look and feel of a single Exchange organization between an on-premises Exchange organization and Exchange Online. 

To accomplish this scenario and allow your on-premises users to take full advantage of Exchange online, attributes from the cloud, must be written back to your on-premises users.  This can be accomplished with either cloud sync or connect sync.
