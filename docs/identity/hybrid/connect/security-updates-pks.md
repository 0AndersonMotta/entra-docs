# Security hardening to the auto-upgrade process for Microsoft Entra Connect and Microsoft Entra Connect Health 

As part of Microsoftâ€™s push to harden the security of our features, we are making service changes to Microsoft Entra Connect Sync and Microsoft Entra Connect Health. This includes a change to Product Key Services. PKS is an internal service used by Microsoft Entra Connect Sync and Microsoft Entra Connect Health to auto-upgrade client components to an updated version. We are in the process of deprecating PKS, as the service is currently being replaced by the Hybrid Upgrade Service (HUS). 

To take advantage of our latest security improvements, we strongly encourage customers to upgrade to the following builds by <deadline>: 

- Microsoft Entra Connect: version X or higher 
- Microsoft Entra Connect Health 
     - Connect Sync agent: version 2.3.2.0 or higher 
     - AD DS agent: version X or higher 
     - AD FS agent: version X or higher
