# Migrate from federation to password hash synchronization for Azure AD

This article describes how to move your organization from using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) to using password hash synchronization.

> [!NOTE]
> [Download](https://aka.ms/ADFSTOPHSDPDownload) this article.

## Prerequisites for migrating to password hash synchronization

The following prerequisites are required to migrate from AD FS to using password hash synchronization.

### Update Azure AD Connect

To successfully complete the steps to migrate to using password hash synchronization, you must have [Azure Active Directory Connect](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=47594) (Azure AD Connect) 1.1.819.0, at a minimum. In this version, the way sign-in conversion is performed changes significantly. The overall time to migrate from AD FS to cloud authentication is reduced from potentially hours to minutes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You might read in outdated documentation, tools, and blogs that user conversion is required when you convert domains from federated identity to managed identity. *Converting users* is no longer required. Microsoft is working to update documentation and tools to reflect this change.

To update Azure AD Connect to the latest version, complete the steps in [Azure AD Connect: Upgrade to the latest version](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-upgrade-previous-version).

### Password hash synchronization required permissions

You can configure Azure AD Connect by using express settings or a custom installation. If you used the custom installation option, the [required permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-accounts-permissions) for password hash synchronization might not be in place.

The Azure AD Connect Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) service account requires the following permissions to synchronize password hashes:

* Replicate Directory Changes
* Replicate Directory Changes All

Now is a good time to verify that these permissions are in place for all domains in the forest.

### Plan the migration method

You can choose from two methods to migrate from federated identity management to password hash synchronization and seamless single sign-on (SSO). The method you use depends on how your AD FS was originally configured.

- **Azure AD Connect**. If AD FS was originally configured by using Azure AD Connect, you *must* change to password hash synchronization by using the Azure AD Connect wizard.

   ‎Azure AD Connect runs the **Set-MsolDomainAuthentication** cmdlet for you automatically when you change the user sign-in method. Azure AD Connect automatically unfederates all the verified federated domains in your Azure AD tenant.  
   ‎  
   > [!NOTE]
   > Currently, if you originally used Azure AD Connect to configure AD FS, you can't avoid unfederating all domains in your tenant when you change the user sign-in to password hash synchronization.  
‎
- **Azure AD Connect with PowerShell**. You can use this method only if you didn't originally configure AD FS by using Azure AD Connect. You still need to change the user sign-in method via the Azure AD Connect wizard. The core difference is that the wizard doesn't automatically run the **Set-MsolDomainAuthentication** cmdlet because it has no awareness of your AD FS farm. With this option, you have full control over which domains are converted and in which order.

To understand which method you should use, complete the steps in the following section.

#### Verify current user sign-in settings

To verify your current user sign-in settings:

1. Sign in to the [Azure AD portal](https://aad.portal.azure.com/) by using a Global Administrator account.
2. In the **User sign-in** section, verify the following settings:
   - **Federation** is set to **Enabled**.
   - **Seamless single sign-on** is set to **Disabled**.
   - **Password Sync** is set to **Disabled**. 

![Screenshot of the settings in the Azure AD Connect User sign-in section](media/plan-migrate-adfs-password-hash-sync/migrating-adfs-to-phs_image1.png)

#### Verify Azure AD Connect configuration

1. On your Azure AD Connect server, open Azure AD Connect. Then, select **Configure**.
2. On the **Additional tasks** page, select **View current configuration**, and then select **Next**.<br />

   ![Screenshot of the View current configuration option selected on the Additional tasks page](media/plan-migrate-adfs-password-hash-sync/migrating-adfs-to-phs_image2.png)<br />    
3. On the **Review Your Solution** page, note of the **Password hash synchronization** status.<br /> 

   If **Password hash synchronization** is set to **Disabled**, complete the steps in this guide to enable it. If **Password hash synchronization** is set to **Enabled**, you can safely skip the section [Step 1: Enable password hash synchronization](#step-1-:-enable-password-hash-synchronization) in this guide.
4. On the **Review Your Solution** page, scroll to **Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)**.<br />
 
   ‎If the AD FS configuration appears in this section, you can safely assume that AD FS was originally configured by using Azure AD Connect. You can convert your domains from federated identity to managed identity by using the Azure AD Connect **Change user sign-in** option. The process is detailed in the section **Option A: Switch from Federation to password hash synchronization by using Azure AD Connect**.
5.  If AD FS isn't listed in the current settings, you must manually convert the domains from federated identity to managed identity by using PowerShell. For more information about this process, see the section **Option B: Switch from Federation to password hash synchronization using Azure AD Connect and PowerShell**.

### Document current federation settings

To find your current federation settings, run the **Get-MsolDomainFederationSettings** cmdlet.

The command is:

``` PowerShell
Get-MsolDomainFederationSettings -DomainName YourDomain.extention | fl *
```

Example:

``` PowerShell
Get-MsolDomainFederationSettings -DomainName Contoso.com | fl *
```
Validate any settings that might have been customized for your federation design and deployment documentation. Specifically, look for customizations in **PreferredAuthenticationProtocol**, **SupportsMfa**, and **PromptLoginBehavior**.

For more information, see these articles:

- [AD FS prompt=login parameter support](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/ad-fs-prompt-login)  
‎- [Set-MsolDomainAuthentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/msonline/set-msoldomainauthentication?view=azureadps-1.0)

> [!NOTE]
> If **SupportsMfa** is set to **True**, you're using an on-premises multi-factor authentication solution to add a second-factor challenge to the user authentication flow. The setup no longer works for Azure AD authentication scenarios. Instead, you must use the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication cloud-based service to perform the same function. Carefully evaluate your MFA requirements before you continue. Make sure that you understand how to use Multi-Factor Authentication, licensing implications, and the end-user registration process before you convert your domains.

#### Backup federation settings

Although no changes are made to other relying parties in your AD FS farm during the process, we recommend that you have a current valid backup of your AD FS farm that you can restore from. You can create a current valid backup by using the free Microsoft [AD FS Rapid Restore Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/ad-fs-rapid-restore-tool). You can use the tool to back up and restore AD FS, either to an existing farm, or use it to create a farm.

If you choose not to use the AD FS Rapid Restore Tool, at a minimum, you should export the Microsoft Office 365 Identity Platform relying party trust and any associated custom claim rules you added. You can export the relying party trust and associated claim rules that you added by using the following PowerShell example:

``` PowerShell
(Get-AdfsRelyingPartyTrust -Name "Microsoft Office 365 Identity Platform") | Export-CliXML "C:\temp\O365-RelyingPartyTrust.xml"
```

## Deployment considerations and AD FS usage

This section describes deployment considerations and details about using AD FS.

### Validate your current AD FS usage

Before converting from Federated to Managed, you should look closely at how you are using AD FS today for Azure AD/Office 365 and other applications (relying party trusts). Specifically, you should consider the following table:

| If | Then |
|-|-|
| You plan to retain AD FS for other applications (other than Azure AD and Office 365) | You will use both AD FS and Azure AD. You need to consider the end-user experience. Users might need to authenticate twice in some scenarios: once to Azure AD (where they will get SSO access to other applications, like Office 365). Users will need to authenticate again for any applications that are still bound to AD FS as a relying party trust. |
| AD FS is heavily customized and reliant on specific customization settings in the onload.js file. The onload.js file can't be duplicated in Azure AD (for example, you have changed the sign-in experience so that users enter only a **SamAccountName** format for their username instead of a UPN, or your organization has heavily branded the sign-in experience)| Before you continue, you must verify that Azure AD can satisfy your current customization requirements. For more information and for guidance, see the AD FS Branding and AD FS Customization sections.|
| You block legacy authentication clients by using AD FS.| Consider replacing the controls currently on AD FS that block legacy authentication clients by using a combination of [conditional access controls for legacy authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/conditions) and [Exchange Online Client Access Rules](http://aka.ms/EXOCAR). |
| You require users to perform multi-factor authentication against an on-premises multi-factor authentication server solution when authenticating to AD FS.| You won't be able to inject a multi-factor authentication challenge via the on-premises multi-factor authentication solution into the authentication flow for a managed domain. However, you can use the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication service for multi-factor authentication after the domain is converted. If users aren't using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication today, a onetime user registration step is required. You'll need to prepare for and communicate the planned registration to your users. |
| You use access control policies (AuthZ rules) today in AD FS to control access to Office 365.| Consider replacing these with the equivalent Azure AD [conditional access policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal) and [Exchange Online Client Access Rules](http://aka.ms/EXOCAR).|

### Considerations for common AD FS customizations

This section describes considerations for common AD FS customizations.

#### InsideCorporateNetwork claim

AD FS issues the **InsideCorporateNetwork** claim if the user who is authenticating is inside the corporate network. This claim can then be passed on to Azure AD. The claim is used to bypass multi-factor authentication based on the user's network location. See [Trusted IPs for federated users](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-get-started-adfs-cloud) for information about how to determine whether this functionality currently is enabled in AD FS.

The **InsideCorporateNetwork** claim isn't available after your domains are converted to password hash synchronization. You can use [named locations in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-named-locations) to replace this functionality.

After you configure named locations, you must update all conditional access policies that were configured to either include or exclude the network locations **All trusted locations** or **MFA Trusted IPs** to reflect the new named locations.

For more information about the Location condition in conditional access, see [Active Directory conditional access locations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-locations).

#### Hybrid Azure AD-joined devices

When you join a device to Azure AD, you can create conditional access rules that enforce that devices meet your access standards for security and compliance. Also, users can sign in to a device by using an organizational work or school account instead of a personal account. When you use hybrid Azure AD-joined devices, you can join your AD domain-joined devices to Azure AD. Your federated environment might have been set up to use this feature.

To ensure that hybrid join continues to work for any new devices that are joined to the domain after your domains are converted to password hash synchronization, you must use Azure AD Connect to sync Active Directory computer accounts for Windows 10 clients to Azure AD. For Windows 8 and Windows 7 computer accounts, hybrid join uses seamless SSO to register the computer in Azure AD. You don't have to sync Windows 8 and Windows 7 computer accounts like you do for Windows 10 devices. However, you must deploy an updated workplacejoin.exe file (via an .msi file) to these down-level clients so they can register themselves by using seamless SSO. [Download the .msi file](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53554).

For more information about this requirement, see [How to configure hybrid Azure Active Directory-joined devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/device-management-hybrid-azuread-joined-devices-setup).

#### Branding

If your organization [customized your AD FS sign-in pages](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/ad-fs-user-sign-in-customization) to display information that's more pertinent to the organization, consider making similar [customizations to the Azure AD sign-in page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/customize-branding).

Although similar customizations are available, some visual changes should be expected. You might want to include expected changes in your communications to your users.

> [!NOTE]
> Company branding is available only if you purchase the Premium or Basic license for Azure AD or if you have an Office 365 license.

## Plan deployment and support

Complete the tasks that are described in this section to help you play for deployment and support.

### Plan the maintenance window

Although the domain conversion process is relatively quick, Azure AD might still send some authentication requests to your AD FS servers for up to 4 hours after the domain conversion is finished. During this 4-hour window, and depending on various service side caches, Azure AD might not accept these authentications. Users might receive an error: they can still successfully authenticate against AD FS, but Azure AD no longer accepts a user’s issued token because that federation trust is now removed.

> [!NOTE]
> This will impact only users who access the services via a web browser during this post-conversion window before the service side cache is cleared. Legacy clients (Exchange ActiveSync, Outlook 2010/2013) aren't expected to be affected because Exchange Online keeps a cache of their credentials for a period of time. The cache is used to reauthenticate the user silently and the user doesn't need to return to AD FS. Credentials stored on the device for these clients are used to reauthenticate themselves silently after this cached is cleared. Users aren't expected to receive any password prompts as a result of the domain conversion process. 

Modern authentication clients (Office 2013/2016, iOS, and Android Apps) use a valid refresh token to obtain new access tokens for continued access to resources instead of returning to AD FS. These clients are immune to any password prompts as a result of the domain conversion process. The clients will continue to function without additional configuration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don’t shut down your AD FS environment or remove the Office 365 relying party trust until you have verified that all users can successfully authenticate by using cloud authentication.

### Plan for rollback

If a major issue is found and can't be resolved quickly, you might decide to roll back the solution to federation. It’s important to plan what to do if your deployment doesn’t go as planned. If the conversion of the domain or users fails during the deployment, or if you need to roll back to federation, you must understand how to mitigate any outage and reduce the effect on your users.

#### To roll back

To plan for rollback, consult your federation design and deployment documentation for your particular deployment details. The process should involve:

* Convert managed domains to federated domains by using the **Convert-MSOLDomainToFederated** cmdlet.
* If necessary, configure additional claims rules.

### Plan change communications

An important part of planning deployment and support is ensuring that your users are proactively informed about the changes. They should know in advance what they might experience and what they must do. 

After both password hash synchronization and seamless SSO are deployed, the user sign-in experience changes for accessing Office 365 and other associated resources that are authenticated through Azure AD. Users who are external to the network see only the Azure AD sign-in page. They aren't redirected to the forms-based page that's presented by external-facing web application proxy servers.

Include the following elements in your communication strategy:

* Notify users about upcoming and released functionality by using:
  * Email and other internal communication channels.
  * Visuals, such as posters.
  * Executive, live, or other communications.
* Determine who will customize the communications, who will send the communications, and when.

## Implement your solution

With your solution planned, you can now implement it. Implementation includes the following components:

1. Enable password hash synchronization.
2. Prepare for seamless SSO.
3. Change the sign-in method to password hash synchronization and enable seamless SSO.

### Step 1: Enable password hash synchronization

The first step to implement this solution is to enable password hash synchronization on the Azure AD Connect wizard. Password hash synchronization is an optional feature that can be enabled on environments using Federation without any impact to the authentication flow. In this case, Azure AD Connect will start synchronizing password hashes without affecting users signing-in using federation.

For this reason, we recommend that you complete this step as a preparation task well before you change your domain's sign-in method. Then, you'll have ample time to verify that password hash synchronization works correctly.

To enable password hash synchronization:

1. On the Azure AD Connect Server, open the wizard, and then select **Configure**.
2. Select **Customize synchronization options**, and then select **Next**.
3. On the **Connect to Azure AD** page. enter the username and password of a Global Administrator account.
4. On the **Connect your directories** page, select **Next**.
5. On the **Domain and OU filtering** page, select **Next**.
6. On the **Optional features** page, select **Password synchronization**, and then select **Next**.
   
   ![Screenshot of the Password synchronization option selected on the Optional features page](media/plan-migrate-adfs-password-hash-sync/migrating-adfs-to-phs_image6.png)<br />
7. Select **Next** on all remaining pages. On the last page, select **Configure**.
8. Azure AD Connect starts to sync password hashes on the next synchronization.

After password hash synchronization is enabled, the password hashes for all users in Azure AD Connect synchronization scope are rehashed and written to Azure AD. Depending on the number of users, this operation might take between minutes and several hours.

For planning purposes, you should estimate that approximately 20,000 users are processed in 1 hour.

To verify that password hash synchronization is correctly working, use the **Troubleshooting** task on the Azure AD Connect wizard

1. Open a new Windows PowerShell session on your Azure AD Connect server by using the Run as Administrator option.
2. Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` or `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`.
3. Start the Azure AD Connect wizard.
4. Go to the **Additional Tasks** page, select **Troubleshoot**, and then select **Next**.
5. On the **Troubleshooting** page, select **Launch** to start the troubleshooting menu in PowerShell.
6. On the main menu, select **Troubleshoot password hash synchronization**.
7. On the sub menu, select **Password hash synchronization does not work at all**.

If you find issues, see [Troubleshoot password hash synchronization with Azure AD Connect sync](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-troubleshoot-password-hash-synchronization) to troubleshoot.

### Step 2: Prepare for seamless SSO

To your devices to use seamless SSO, add an Azure AD URL to users' intranet zone settings by using a group policy in Active Directory.

By default, web browsers automatically calculate the correct zone, either internet or intranet, from a URL. For example, **http:\/\/contoso/** maps to the intranet zone and **http:\/\/intranet.contoso.com** maps to the internet zone (because the URL contains a period). Browsers send Kerberos tickets to a cloud endpoint like the Azure AD URL only if you explicitly add the URL to the browser's intranet zone.

Complete the steps to [roll out](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-sso-quick-start) the required changes to your devices.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Making this change doesn't modify the way your users sign in to Azure AD. However, it’s important that you apply this configuration to all your devices before you continue with the step 3. Also, note that users who sign in on devices that haven't received this configuration simply are required to enter a username and password to sign in to Azure AD.

### Step 3: Change the sign-in method to password hash sync and enable seamless SSO

#### Option A: Switch from federation to password hash sync by using Azure AD Connect

Use this method if your AD FS instance was initially configured by using Azure AD Connect. You can't use this method if your AD FS instance wasn't originally configured by using Azure AD Connect. First, change the user sign-in method:

1. On the Azure AD Connect Server, open the wizard.
2. Select **Change user sign-in**, and then select **Next**.

   ![Screenshot of the Change user sign-in option on the Additional tasks page](media/plan-migrate-adfs-password-hash-sync/migrating-adfs-to-phs_image7.png)<br />
3. On the **Connect to Azure AD** page, enter the username and password of a Global Administrator account.
4. On the **User sign-in** page, select the **Password hash synchronization button**. Make sure to select the **Do not convert user accounts** check box. The option is deprecated. Select **Enable single sign-on**, and then select **Next**.

   ![Screenshot of the Enable single sign-on page](media/plan-migrate-adfs-password-hash-sync/migrating-adfs-to-phs_image8.png)<br />
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > Starting with Azure AD Connect version 1.1.880.0, the **Seamless single sign-on** check box is selected by default.
   
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > You can safely ignore the warnings that indicate that user conversion and full password hash synchronization are required steps for converting from federation to cloud authentication. Note that these steps aren't required anymore. If you still see these warnings, make sure that you're running the latest version of Azure AD Connect and that you're using the latest version of this guide. For more information, see the section [Update Azure AD Connect](#update-azure-ad-connect).
   
5. On the **Enable single sign-on** page, enter the credentials of Domain Administrator account, and then select **Next**.

   ![Screenshot of the Enable single sign-on page](media/plan-migrate-adfs-password-hash-sync/migrating-adfs-to-phs_image9.png)<br />
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > Domain Administrator account credentials are required to enable seamless SSO. The process completes the following actions, which require these elevated permissions. The Domain Administrator account credentials aren't stored in Azure AD Connect or in Azure AD. The Domain Administrator account credentials are used only to enable the feature. The credentials are discarded when the process successfully finishes.
   >
   > 1. A computer account named AZUREADSSOACC (which represents Azure AD) is created in your on-premises Active Directory instance.
   > 2. The computer account's Kerberos decryption key is shared securely with Azure AD.
   > 3. Two Kerberos service principal names (SPNs) are created to represent two URLs that are used during Azure AD sign-in.
   > 4. The Domain Administrator account credentials aren't stored in Azure AD Connect or Azure AD. The credentials are used only to enable the feature. The credentials are when the process successfully finishes.
   
6. On the **Ready to configure** page, make sure that **Start the synchronization process when configuration completes** check box is selected. Then, select **Configure**.
      
      ![Screenshot of the Ready to configure page](media/plan-migrate-adfs-password-hash-sync/migrating-adfs-to-phs_image10.png)<br />
   
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > At this point, all your federated domains will change to managed authentication. Password hash synchronization is the new method of authentication.
       
7. Open the Azure AD portal, select Azure Active Directory, and then select Azure AD Connect.
8. Verify these settings:
  - **Federation** is set to **Disabled**.
  - **Seamless single sign-on** is set to **Enabled**.
  - **Password Sync** is set to **Enabled**.<br /> 

   ![Screenshot that shows the settings in the User sign-in section ](media/plan-migrate-adfs-password-hash-sync/migrating-adfs-to-phs_image11.png)<br />

Skip to [Testing and next steps](#testing-and-next-steps).
   
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Skip the section **Option B: Switch from federation to password hash sync by using Azure AD Connect and PowerShell**. The steps in that section don't apply.  

#### Option B: Switch from federation to password hash sync using Azure AD Connect and PowerShell

Use this option if your federation wasn't initially configured by using Azure AD Connect.

During the process, you enable seamless SSO and switch your domains from federated to managed.

1. On the Azure AD Connect Server, open the wizard.
2. Select **Change user sign-in**, and then select **Next**. 
3. On the **Connect to Azure AD** page, enter the username and password for a Global Administrator account.
4. On the **User sign-in** page, select the **Password hash synchronization** button. Select **Enable single sign-on**, and then select **Next**.
   
   Before the change:
   ![Screenshot that shows the Do not configure option on the User sign-in page](media/plan-migrate-adfs-password-hash-sync/migrating-adfs-to-phs_image12.png)<br />

   After the change:  
   ![Screenshot that shows new options on the User sign-in page ](media/plan-migrate-adfs-password-hash-sync/migrating-adfs-to-phs_image13.png)<br />
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > Starting with Azure AD Connect version 1.1.880.0, the **Seamless single sign-on** check box is selected by default.
   
5. On the **Enable single sign-on** page, enter the credentials for a Domain Administrator account, and then select **Next**.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > Domain Administrator credentials are required for enabling Seamless Single Sign-on as the process performs the following actions which require these elevated permissions. The domain administrator credentials aren't stored in Azure AD Connect or in Azure AD. They're used only to enable the feature and then discarded after successful completion.
   > * A computer account named AZUREADSSOACC (which represents Azure AD) is created in your on-premises Active Directory (AD).
   > * The computer account's Kerberos decryption key is shared securely with Azure AD.
   > * In addition, two Kerberos service principal names (SPNs) are created to represent two URLs that are used during Azure AD sign-in.
   
6. On the **Ready to configure** page, make sure that the **Start the synchronization process when configuration completes** check box is selected. Then, select **Configure**.

   ![Screenshot that shows the Configure button on the Ready to configure page](media/plan-migrate-adfs-password-hash-sync/migrating-adfs-to-phs_image15.png)<br />
   When you select the **Configure** button, seamless SSO is configured as indicated in the preceding step. Password hash synchronization configuration isn't modified because it was enabled earlier.
   
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > No changes are made to the way users sign in at this time.  
   
7. In the Azure AD portal, verify these settings:
   * **Federation** is set to **Enabled**.
   * **Seamless single sign-on** is set to **Enabled**.
   * **Password Sync** is set to **Enabled**.

   ![Screenshot that shows the settings in the User sign-in section](media/plan-migrate-adfs-password-hash-sync/migrating-adfs-to-phs_image16.png)

#### Convert domains from federated to managed

At this point, federation is still enabled and operational for your domains. To continue with the deployment, each domain needs to be converted from federated to managed to force user authentication via password hash synchronization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You don't have to convert all domains at the same time. You might choose to start with a test domain on your production tenant, or start with your domain that has the lowest number of users.

The conversion is performed by using the Azure AD PowerShell module:

1. In PowerShell, sign in to Azure AD by using a Global Administrator account.  
2. To convert the first domain, run the following command:  
   
   ``` PowerShell
   Set-MsolDomainAuthentication -Authentication Managed -DomainName <domainname>
   ```
   
3. In the Azure AD portal, select **Azure Active Directory** > **Azure AD Connect**.
4. Verify that the domain has been converted to managed by running the following command:
   
   ``` PowerShell
   Get-MsolDomain -DomainName <domain name>
   ```

## Testing and next steps

Complete the following tasks to verify password hash synchronization and to complete the conversion process.

### Test authentication by using password hash synchronization 

When your tenant used federated identity, users were redirected from the Azure AD sign-in page to your AD FS environment. Now that the tenant is configured to use password hash synchronization instead of federation authentication, users aren't redirected to AD FS. Instead, users sign in directly on the Azure AD sign-in page.

1. Open Internet Explorer in InPrivate mode so that seamless SSO doesn't sign you in automatically.
2. Go to the Office 365 sign-in page ([http://portal.office.com](http://portal.office.com/)).
3. Enter a user UPN, and then select **Next**. Make sure you enter the UPN of a hybrid user that was synced from your on-premises Active Directory instance, and who previously used federated authentication. A page on which you enter the username and password appears:

   ![Screenshot that shows the sign-in page in which you enter a username](media/plan-migrate-adfs-password-hash-sync/migrating-adfs-to-phs_image18.pn)

   ![Screenshot that shows the sign-in page in which you enter a password](media/plan-migrate-adfs-password-hash-sync/migrating-adfs-to-phs_image19.png)

4. After you enter the password and select **Sign in**, you're redirected to the Office 365 portal.

   ![Screenshot that shows the Office 365 portal](media/plan-migrate-adfs-password-hash-sync/migrating-adfs-to-phs_image20.png)


### Test seamless SSO

1. Sign in to a domain-joined machine that is connected to the corporate network. 
2. In Internet Explorer or Chrome, go to one of the following URLs (replace "contoso" with your domain):   
      ‎  
   - `https://myapps.microsoft.com/contoso.com`
   - `https://myapps.microsoft.com/contoso.onmicrosoft.com`

   The user is briefly redirected to the Azure AD sign-in page that shows the message "Trying to sign you in." The user isn't prompted for a username or password.<br />

   ![Screenshot that shows the Azure AD sign-in page and message](media/plan-migrate-adfs-password-hash-sync/migrating-adfs-to-phs_image21.png)<br />
3. The user is redirected and is successfully signed in to the access panel:

   > [!NOTE]
   > Seamless SSO works on Office 365 services that support domain hint (for example, myapps.microsoft.com/contoso.com). Currently, the Office 365 portal (portal.office.com) doesn’t support domain hint. Users are required to type their UPN. After a UPN is entered, seamless SSO retrieves the Kerberos ticket on behalf of the user. The user is signed in without entering a password.
   
   > [!TIP]
   > Consider deploying [Azure AD hybrid join on Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/device-management-introduction) for an improved SSO experience.

### Remove the relying party trust

After you validate that all users and clients are successfully authenticating via Azure AD, it's safe to remove the Office 365 relying party trust.

If you don't use AD FS for other purposes (for other relying party trusts), it's safe to decommission AD FS at this point.

### Roll back

If you discover a major issue and can't resolve it quickly, you might choose to roll back the solution back to federation.

Consult your federation design and deployment documentation for your specific deployment details. The process should involve these tasks:

* Convert managed domains to federated authentication by using the **Convert-MSOLDomainToFederated** cmdlet.
* If necessary, configure additional claims rules.

### Sync userPrincipalName updates

Historically, updates to the **UserPrincipalName** attribute, which uses the sync service from the on-premises environment, are blocked unless both of these conditions are true:

* The user is in a managed (non-federated) identity domain.
* The user hasn't been assigned a license.

To learn how to verify or turn on this feature, see [Sync userPrincipalName updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsyncservice-features).

### Troubleshooting

Your support team should understand how to troubleshoot any authentication issues that arise either during, or after the change from federation to managed. Use the following troubleshooting documentation to help your support team familiarize themselves with the common troubleshooting steps and appropriate actions that can help to isolate and resolve the issue.

## Roll over the seamless SSO Kerberos decryption key

It's important to frequently roll over the Kerberos decryption key of the AZUREADSSOACC computer account (which represents Azure AD). The AZUREADSSOACC computer account is created in your on-premises Active Directory forest. We highly recommend that you roll over the Kerberos decryption key at least every 30 days to align with the way that Active Directory domain members submit password changes. There's no associated device attached to the AZUREADSSOACC computer account object, so you must perform the rollover manually.

Follow these steps on the on-premises server where you are running Azure AD Connect to initiate the roll-over of the Kerberos decryption key.
