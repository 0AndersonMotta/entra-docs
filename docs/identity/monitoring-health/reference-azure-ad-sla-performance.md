# Azure Active Directory SLA for performance 

Use this document to see how the Azure AD service has performed according to the [SLA for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/active-directory/v1_1/). This document shows worldwide SLA performance for Azure AD tenants.  

## No planned downtime 

You rely on Azure AD to provide identity and access management for your vital systems. To ensure Azure AD is available when business operations require it, Microsoft does not plan downtime for Azure AD system maintenance. Instead, maintenance is performed as the service runs, without customer impact. 

## Recent worldwide SLA performance 

To help you plan for moving workloads to Azure AD, we publish past SLA performance. These numbers show the level at which Azure AD met the requirements in the [SLA for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/active-directory/v1_1/), for all tenants. 

  

  

  

## Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of past incidents 

All incidents that cause Azure AD to go below its SLA for a set of customers are documented in the [Azure status history](https://status.azure.com/status/history/). You can view information about the impact of incidents, as well as a root cause analysis of what caused the incident and what steps Microsoft took to prevent future incidents.
