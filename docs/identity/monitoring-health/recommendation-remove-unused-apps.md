# Azure AD recommendation: Remove unused applications (preview)
[Azure AD recommendations](overview-recommendations.md) is a feature that provides you with personalized insights and actionable guidance to align your tenant with recommended best practices.

This article covers the recommendation to investigate unused applications. This recommendation is called `UnusedApps` in the recommendations API in Microsoft Graph. 

## Description

Applications registered with your tenant require permissions to access resources and services. These permissions could be misused if applications are registered but not actively used.

Application credentials, which are used to get a token that grants access to a resource or another service. Only applications actively used in your tenant should be registered.

This recommendation shows up if your tenant has applications that haven't been used in more than 30 days, so haven't been issued any tokens. Applications or service principals that were added but never used will show up as unused apps, which will also trigger this recommendation.

## Value 

Removing unused applications improves the security posture and promotes good application hygiene. It reduces the risk of application compromise by someone discovering an unused application and misuse it to get tokens. Depending on the permissions granted to the application and the resources that it exposes, an application compromise could expose sensitive data in an organization.

## Action plan

1. Navigate to **Azure AD** > **App registration** and locate the application that was surfaced as part of this recommendation.
1. We suggest you take appropriate steps to ensure the application is not used in longer intervals of more than 30 days. If so, we recommend updating the frequency of access such that the applicationâ€™s last used time is within 30 days from its last access date.

## Known limitations

The time frame for application usage that triggers this recommendation cannot be customized.

The following apps will not show up as a part of this recommendation: 
- Microsoft-owned applications
- Password single sign-on
- Linked single sign-on
- App proxy
- Add-in apps

This recommendation currently surfaces applications that were created within the past 30 days *and* shows as unused. Updates to the recommendation to filter out newly-created apps so that they can complete a full cycle are in progress.
