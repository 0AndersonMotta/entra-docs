# How to download logs in Microsoft Entra ID

The Microsoft Entra admin center gives you access to three types of activity logs:

- **[Sign-ins](concept-sign-ins.md)**: Information about sign-ins and how your resources are used by your users.
- **[Audit](concept-audit-logs.md)**: Information about changes applied to your tenant such as users and group management or updates applied to your tenantâ€™s resources.
- **[Provisioning](concept-provisioning-logs.md)**: Activities performed by a provisioning service, such as the creation of a group in ServiceNow or a user imported from Workday.

Microsoft Entra ID stores the data in these logs for a limited amount of time. As an IT administrator, you can download your activity logs to have a long-term backup. This article explains how to download activity logs in Microsoft Entra ID.

## Prerequisites

The option to download the data of an activity log is available in all editions of Microsoft Entra ID. You can also download activity logs using Microsoft Graph; however, downloading logs programmatically requires a [premium license](../../fundamentals/licensing.md#microsoft-entra-monitoring-and-health).

## Log download considerations

Microsoft Entra ID stores activity logs for a specific period, depending on your license. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra data retention](reference-reports-data-retention.md). By downloading the logs, you can control how long logs are stored.

- Microsoft Entra ID supports the following formats for your download:
  - **CSV**
  - **JSON**
- Timestamps in the downloaded files are based on UTC.
- For large data sets (> 250,000 records), you should use the [reporting API](/graph/api/resources/azure-ad-auditlog-overview) to download the data.

> [!NOTE]
> **Issues downloading large data sets**  
> The Microsoft Entra admin center download service will time out if you attempt to download large data sets. Generally, data sets smaller than 250,000 records work well with the browser download feature. If you face issues completing large downloads in the browser, you should use the [reporting API](/graph/api/resources/azure-ad-auditlog-overview) to download the data.

The columns in the downloaded logs do not change. The output contains all details of the audit or sign-in log, *regardless of the columns you customized in the Microsoft Entra admin center*. If you set a custom filter, however, the output in the downloaded logs contain only the results that match the filter.

The following image contains a message that appears in the Microsoft Entra admin center: "Your download will be based on the filter selections you have made." This message is referring to the results of the filter and not the columns you can see.

## How to download activity logs

You can access the activity logs from the **Monitoring and health** section of Microsoft Entra ID or from the area of Microsoft Entra ID where you're working.

For example, if you're in the **Groups** or **Licenses** section of Microsoft Entra ID, you can access the audit logs for those specific activities directly from that area. When you access the audit logs in this way, the filter categories are automatically set. If you're in **Groups**, the audit log filter category is set to **GroupManagement**.
