# How to: Use Azure Monitor workbooks for Azure Active Directory reports

[Azure Monitor workbooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/usage-workbooks) combine text,â€¯Analytics queries, Azure Metrics, and parameters into rich interactive reports. Azure Active Directory provides the following workbooks to help you gain insights into your environment. 

* Usage: This workbook contains information about application usage, sign-ins, conditional access policies, and legacy authentication.
* Troubleshooting: This workbook contains information about errors that occur during attempted sign-ins, conditional access policies and legacy authentication.

Workbooks are editable by any other team members who have access to the same Azure resources.

## Prerequisites

To use this feature, you need:

1. An Azure Active Directory tenant, with a premium (P1/P2) license. Learn how to [get a premium license](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-get-started-premium).
2. A [Log Analytics workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace).

## Open the workbooks from Azure portal

You can filter this data by selecting a specific time range or application using the drop-down menus. You can also edit, save, or share the workbook using the buttons on the top bar.
