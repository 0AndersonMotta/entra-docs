# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Kanbanize

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Kanbanize with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Kanbanize with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Kanbanize.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Kanbanize (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Kanbanize, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* Kanbanize single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Kanbanize supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* Kanbanize supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding Kanbanize from the gallery

To configure the integration of Kanbanize into Azure AD, you need to add Kanbanize from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Kanbanize from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

	![The Azure Active Directory button](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, type **Kanbanize**, select **Kanbanize** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Kanbanize in the results list](common/search-new-app.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Kanbanize based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Kanbanize needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Kanbanize, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Kanbanize Single Sign-On](#configure-kanbanize-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Kanbanize test user](#create-kanbanize-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Kanbanize that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Kanbanize, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Kanbanize** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    ![Kanbanize Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/idp-relay.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.kanbanize.com/`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.kanbanize.com/saml/acs`

    c. Click **Set additional URLs**.

    d. In the **Relay State** textbox, type a URL: `/ctrl_login/saml_login`

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    ![Kanbanize Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/metadata-upload-additional-signon.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.kanbanize.com`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [Kanbanize Client support team](mailto:support@ms.kanbanize.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

6. Kanbanize application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, where as nameidentifier is mapped with **user.userprincipalname**. Kanbanize application expects nameidentifier to be mapped with **user.mail**, so you need to edit the attribute mapping by clicking on Edit icon and change the attribute mapping.

    ![Attribute](common/edit-attribute.png)

7. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/certificatebase64.png)

8. On the **Set up Kanbanize** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

	a. Login URL

	b. Azure AD Identifier

	c. Logout URL

### Configure Kanbanize Single Sign-On

1. In a different web browser window, sign in to Kanbanize as a Security Administrator.

### Create Kanbanize test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Kanbanize. Kanbanize supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Kanbanize, a new one is created after authentication. If you need to create a user manually, contact [Kanbanize Client support team](mailto:support@ms.kanbanize.com).

### Test single sign-on 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Kanbanize tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Kanbanize for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
