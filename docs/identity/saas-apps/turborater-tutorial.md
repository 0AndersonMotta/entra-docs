# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with TurboRater

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate TurboRater with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating TurboRater with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to TurboRater.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed in to TurboRater (single sign-on) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

Fore details about software as a service (SaaS) app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with TurboRater, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* A TurboRater subscription with single sign-on enabled.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

TurboRater supports IDP-initiated single sign-on (SSO).

## Adding TurboRater from the Azure Marketplace

To configure the integration of TurboRater into Azure AD, you need to add TurboRater from the Azure Marketplace to your list of managed SaaS apps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true).
1. In the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**.

2. Go to **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All Applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications option](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add a new application, select **+ New application** at the top of the pane.

	![The New application option](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, enter **TurboRater**. In the search results, select **TurboRater**, and then select **Add** to add the application.

	 ![TurboRater in the results list](common/search-new-app.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with TurboRater based on a test user named  **Britta Simon**. For single sign-on to work, you must establish a link between an Azure AD user and the related user in TurboRater.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with TurboRater, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD single sign-on](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure TurboRater single sign-on](#configure-turborater-single-sign-on)** to configure the single sign-on settings on the application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create a TurboRater test user](#create-turborater-test-user)** so that there's a user named Britta Simon in TurboRater that's linked to the Azure AD user named Britta Simon.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with TurboRater, take the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **TurboRater** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on option](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a single sign-on method** pane, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** pane, do the following steps:

    ![TurboRater domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/idp-intiated.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** box, enter a URL:

    `https://www.itcdataservices.com`

    b. In the **Reply URL** box, enter a URL by using the following pattern:

    | Environment | URL |
	| ---------------| --------------- |    
	| Test  | `https://ratingqa.itcdataservices.com/webservices/imp/saml/login` |
	| Live  | `https://www.itcratingservices.com/webservices/imp/saml/login` |

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual identifier and reply URL. To get these values, contact the [TurboRater support team](https://www.getitc.com/support). You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** pane in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** pane, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download option](common/metadataxml.png)

6. On the **Set up TurboRater** section, copy the URL or URLs that you need:

   * **Login URL**
   * **Azure AD Identifier**
   * **Logout URL**

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

### Configure TurboRater single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on the TurboRater side, you need to send the downloaded Federation Metadata XML and the appropriate copied URLs from the Azure portal to the [TurboRater support team](https://www.getitc.com/support). The TurboRater team will make sure the SAML SSO connection is set properly on both sides.

### Create an Azure AD test user

The objective of this section is to create a test user in the Azure portal called Britta Simon.

1. In the Azure portal, in the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.

    ![The "Users and groups" and "All users" links](common/users.png)

2. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.

    ![New user Button](common/new-user.png)

    a. In the **Name** field enter **BrittaSimon**.
  
    b. In the **User name** field type brittasimon@yourcompanydomain.extension. For example, BrittaSimon@contoso.com

    c. Select **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the Password box.

    d. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to TurboRater.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, select **All applications**, then select **TurboRater**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

2. In the applications list, select **TurboRater**.

	![The TurboRater link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

3. In the menu on the left, select **Users and groups**.

    ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

4. Click the **Add user** button, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

    ![The Add Assignment pane](common/add-assign-user.png)

5. In the **Users and groups** dialog select **Britta Simon** in the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

6. If you are expecting any role value in the SAML assertion then in the **Select Role** dialog select the appropriate role for the user from the list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

7. In the **Add Assignment** dialog click the **Assign** button.

### Create TurboRater test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in TurboRater. Work withÂ [TurboRater support team](https://www.getitc.com/support) to add the users in the TurboRater platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

### Test single sign-on 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the TurboRater tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the TurboRater for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
