# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with Prosci Portal

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate Prosci Portal with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Prosci Portal is the workbench to class leading change management tools and resources. When you integrate Prosci Portal with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Prosci Portal.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Prosci Portal with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Prosci Portal in a test environment. Prosci Portal supports only **SP** initiated single sign-on.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with Prosci Portal, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Prosci Portal single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Prosci Portal application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Prosci Portal from the Azure AD gallery

Add Prosci Portal from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with Prosci Portal. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides). 

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Prosci Portal** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type one of the following values:

    | **Environment**| **URL** |
    |------------|---------|
    | Production |`urn:auth0:prosci-prod:microsoft`|
    | Staging |`urn:auth0:prosci-staging:microsoft`|

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type one of the following URLs:

    | **Environment**| **URL** |
    |------------|---------|
    | Production | `https://id.prosci.com/login/callback?connection=microsoft` |
    | Staging | `https://id-staging.prosci.com/login/callback?connection=microsoft` |

	c. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type one of the following URLs:
    
    | **Environment**| **URL** |
    |------------|---------|
    | Production | `https://id.prosci.com` |
    | Staging | `https://id-staging.prosci.com` |

    d. In the **Relay State** textbox, type one of the following URLs:

    | **Environment**| **URL** |
    |------------|---------|
    | Production | `https://portal.prosci.com` |
    | Staging | `https://portal-staging.prosci.com` |

    e. In the **Logout Url** textbox, type one of the following URLs:

    | **Environment**| **URL** |
    |------------|---------|
    | Production | `https://id.prosci.com/logout` |
    | Staging | `https://id-staging.prosci.com/logout` |

1. On the **Set-up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/metadataxml.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up Prosci Portal** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

## Configure Prosci Portal SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Prosci Portal** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Prosci Portal support team](mailto:support@prosci.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Prosci Portal test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon at Prosci Portal SSO. Work with [Prosci Portal support team](mailto:support@prosci.com) to add the users in the Prosci Portal SSO platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Prosci Portal Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.

* Go to Prosci Portal Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Prosci Portal tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Prosci Portal Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

* [Plan a single sign-on deployment](../manage-apps/plan-sso-deployment.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Prosci Portal you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
