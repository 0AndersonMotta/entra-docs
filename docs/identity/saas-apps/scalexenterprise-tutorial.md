# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with ScaleX Enterprise

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate ScaleX Enterprise with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating ScaleX Enterprise with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to ScaleX Enterprise.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to ScaleX Enterprise (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with ScaleX Enterprise, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* ScaleX Enterprise single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* ScaleX Enterprise supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding ScaleX Enterprise from the gallery

To configure the integration of ScaleX Enterprise into Azure AD, you need to add ScaleX Enterprise from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add ScaleX Enterprise from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with ScaleX Enterprise based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in ScaleX Enterprise needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with ScaleX Enterprise, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure ScaleX Enterprise Single Sign-On](#configure-scalex-enterprise-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create ScaleX Enterprise test user](#create-scalex-enterprise-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in ScaleX Enterprise that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with ScaleX Enterprise, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **ScaleX Enterprise** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    ![ScaleX Enterprise Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/idp-intiated.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://platform.rescale.com/saml2/<company id>/`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://platform.rescale.com/saml2/<company id>/acs/`

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    ![ScaleX Enterprise Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/metadata-upload-additional-signon.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://platform.rescale.com/saml2/<company id>/sso/`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [ScaleX Enterprise Client support team](https://info.rescale.com/contact_sales) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

6. Your ScaleX Enterprise application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, where as **emailaddress** is mapped with **user.mail**. ScaleX Enterprise application expects **emailaddress** to be mapped with **user.userprincipalname**, so you need to edit the attribute mapping by clicking on **Edit** icon and change the attribute mapping.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

7. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/certificatebase64.png)

8. On the **Set up ScaleX Enterprise** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

### Create ScaleX Enterprise test user

To enable Azure AD users to sign in to ScaleX Enterprise, they must be provisioned in to ScaleX Enterprise. In the case of ScaleX Enterprise, provisioning is an automatic task and no manual steps are required. Any user who can successfully authenticate with SSO credentials will be automatically provisioned on the ScaleX side.

### Test single sign-on

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the ScaleX Enterprise tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the ScaleX Enterprise for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
