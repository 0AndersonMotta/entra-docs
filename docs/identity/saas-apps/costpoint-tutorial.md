# Tutorial: Integrate Costpoint with Azure Active Directory

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Costpoint with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Costpoint with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Costpoint.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Costpoint with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A Costpoint single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario Description

In this tutorial, you will configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment. Costpoint supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

## Generate Costpoint Metadata

Costpoint SAML SSO configuration is explained in the **DeltekCostpoint711Security.pdf** guide. Download this guide from the Deltek Costpoint support site and refer to the **SAML Single Sign-on Setup -> Configure SAML Single Sign-on between Costpoint and Microsoft Azure** section. Follow the instructions and generate **Costpoint SP Federation Metadata XML** file.

## Adding Costpoint from the Gallery

To configure the integration of Costpoint into Azure AD, you need to add Costpoint from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.

1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.

1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and select the **All Applications** option.

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. To add a new application, select **New application**.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, enter **Costpoint** into the search box.

	![Costpoint in the results list](common/search-new-app.png)

1. Select **Costpoint** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and Test Azure AD Single Sign-on

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Costpoint using a test user named **Britta Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Costpoint.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Costpoint, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** to enable your users to use this feature.
1. **[Configure Costpoint](#configure-costpoint)** to configure the SAML SSO settings on application side.
1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Create Costpoint test user](#create-costpoint-test-user)** to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Costpoint that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** to verify whether the configuration works.



### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.


1. On the **Costpoint** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML** mode to enable single sign-on.

	![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

1. Click the **Upload metadata file** button at the top, select the **Costpoint SP Federation Metadata XML** file previously generated by Costpoint, and click the Add button to upload the file.

	![Upload Metadata File](./media/costpoint-tutorial/upload-metadata.png)

1. If the **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog box is not already open, click the **Edit** icon to open it.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. Verify that **Identifier (Entity ID)** and **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** are correctly set and that **ACS URL** is a valid Costpoint URL ending with **/LoginServlet.cps**.

	![Costpoint Basic SAML Configuration](./media/costpoint-tutorial/basic-saml-configuration.png)

1. In the **Relay State** text box, enter a value using the following pattern: **system=[your system]**, (for example, **system=DELTEKCP**).

	![Costpoint Relay State](./media/costpoint-tutorial/relay-state.png)

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click the **Copy** icon to copy the **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it to Notepad.

	![SAML Signing Certificate](common/copy-metadataurl.png)


### Configure Costpoint

1. Return to **Costpoint Configuration Utility** and paste the **App Federation Metadata Url** into the **IdP Federation Metadata XML** text box. 

	![Costpoint Configuration Utility](./media/costpoint-tutorial/config-utility-idp.png)

1. Continue the instructions from the **DeltekCostpoint711Security.pdf** guide to finish the Costpoint SAML setup.

### Create an Azure AD Test User

The objective of this section is to create a test user in the Azure portal named Britta Simon.

1. In the Azure portal, in the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory > Users > All users**.

    ![The "Users and groups" and "All users" links](common/users.png)

1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.

    ![New user Button](common/new-user.png)

1. In the User properties, perform the following steps.

    ![The User dialog box](common/user-properties.png)

    1. In the **Name** field, enter **BrittaSimon**.
  
    1. In the **User name** field, enter `brittasimon\@yourcompanydomain.extension` (for example, BrittaSimon@contoso.com).

    1. Select the **Show Password** check box, and  write down the value that's displayed in the Password field.

    1. Click **Create**.


### Assign the Azure AD Test User

In this section, you'll enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting Britta access to Costpoint.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications > All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Costpoint**.
1. In the **Manage** section of the app's overview page, select **Users and groups**.

	![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**, and select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog box.

	![The Add User link](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog box, select **Britta Simon** from the Users list, and click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog box, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog box, click the **Assign** button.

### Create Costpoint Test User

In this section, you will create a user in Costpoint. Assume the user id is BSIMON and the name Britta Simon. Work with the [Costpoint Client support team](https://www.deltek.com/about/contact-us) to add the user in the Costpoint platform. The user must be created and activated before you use single sign-on. 
Once created, the user's **Authentication Method** selection must be **Active Directory**, the **SAML Single Sign-on** check box must be selected, and the user name from Azure Active Directory must be **Active Directory or Certificate ID** (as shown below).

![Costpoint User](./media/costpoint-tutorial/costpoint-user.png)


### Test SSO

When you select the Costpoint tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Costpoint for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
