# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with BenSelect

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate BenSelect with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating BenSelect with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to BenSelect.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to BenSelect (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with BenSelect, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* BenSelect single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* BenSelect supports **IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding BenSelect from the gallery

To configure the integration of BenSelect into Azure AD, you need to add BenSelect from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add BenSelect from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with BenSelect based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in BenSelect needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with BenSelect, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure BenSelect Single Sign-On](#configure-benselect-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create BenSelect test user](#create-benselect-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in BenSelect that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with BenSelect, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **BenSelect** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    ![BenSelect Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/idp-reply.png)

    In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.benselect.com/enroll/login.aspx?Path=<tenant name>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The value is not real. Update the value with the actual Reply URL. Contact [BenSelect Client support team](mailto:support@selerix.com) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. BenSelect application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format. Configure the following claims for this application. You can manage the values of these attributes from the **User Attributes** section on application integration page. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** button to open **User Attributes** dialog.

	a. Select **Transformation** as a **Source**.

	b. In the **Transformation** dropdown list, select **ExtractMailPrefix()**.

	c. In the **Parameter 1** dropdown list, select **user.userprincipalname**.

	d. Click **Save**.

8. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate(Raw)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/certificateraw.png)

9. On the **Set up BenSelect** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

	a. Login URL

	b. Azure AD Identifier

	c. Logout URL

### Configure BenSelect Single Sign-On

To configure single sign-on on **BenSelect** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate(Raw)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [BenSelect support team](mailto:support@selerix.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

> [!NOTE]
> You need to mention that this integration requires the SHA256 algorithm (SHA1 is not supported) to set the SSO on the appropriate server like app2101 etc.

### Create an Azure AD test user

The objective of this section is to create a test user in the Azure portal called Britta Simon.

1. In the Azure portal, in the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.

    ![The "Users and groups" and "All users" links](common/users.png)

2. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.

    ![New user Button](common/new-user.png)

    b. In the **User name** field type `brittasimon@yourcompanydomain.extension`. For example, BrittaSimon@contoso.com

    c. Select **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the Password box.

    d. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to BenSelect.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, select **All applications**, then select **BenSelect**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

2. In the applications list, select **BenSelect**.

	![The BenSelect link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

    ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

4. Click the **Add user** button, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

    ![The Add Assignment pane](common/add-assign-user.png)

5. In the **Users and groups** dialog select **Britta Simon** in the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

6. If you are expecting any role value in the SAML assertion then in the **Select Role** dialog select the appropriate role for the user from the list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

7. In the **Add Assignment** dialog click the **Assign** button.

### Create BenSelect test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in BenSelect. Work withÂ [BenSelect support team](mailto:support@selerix.com) to add the users in the BenSelect platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

### Test single sign-on

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the BenSelect tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the BenSelect for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
