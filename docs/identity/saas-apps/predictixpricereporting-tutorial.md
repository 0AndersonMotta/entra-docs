# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Predictix Price Reporting

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Predictix Price Reporting with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

This integration provides these benefits:

* You can use Azure AD to control who has access to Predictix Price Reporting.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed in to Predictix Price Reporting (single sign-on) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [Single sign-on to applications in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you start.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Predictix Price Reporting, you need to have the following:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can sign up for a [one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) subscription.
* A Predictix Price Reporting subscription that has single sign-on enabled.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Predictix Price Reporting supports SP-initiated SSO.

## Adding Predictix Price Reporting from the gallery

To set up the integration of Predictix Price Reporting into Azure AD, you need to add Predictix Price Reporting from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), in the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**:

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Predictix Price Reporting by using a test user named **Britta Simon**.
To enable single sign-on, you need to establish a relationship between an Azure AD user and the corresponding user in Predictix Price Reporting.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Predictix Price Reporting, you need to complete these steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD single sign-on](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** to enable the feature for your users.
2. **[Configure Predictix Price Reporting single sign-on](#configure-predictix-price-reporting-single-sign-on)** to set up single sign-on on the application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Azure AD single sign-on.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable Azure AD single sign-on for the user.
5. **[Create a Predictix Price Reporting test user](#create-a-predictix-price-reporting-test-user)** that's linked to the Azure AD representation of the user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** to verify that the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you'll enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.
