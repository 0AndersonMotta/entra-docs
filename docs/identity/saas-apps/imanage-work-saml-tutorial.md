# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with iManage Work (SAML)

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate iManage Work (SAML) with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate iManage Work (SAML) with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to iManage Work (SAML).
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to iManage Work (SAML) with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with iManage Work (SAML), you need:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* iManage Work (SAML) single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* iManage Work (SAML) supports both **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add iManage Work (SAML) from the gallery

To configure the integration of iManage Work (SAML) into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add iManage Work (SAML) from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **iManage Work (SAML)** in the search box.
1. Select **iManage Work (SAML)** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for iManage Work (SAML)

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with iManage Work (SAML) using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in iManage Work (SAML).

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with iManage Work (SAML), perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-microsoft-entra-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra ID test user](#create-a-microsoft-entra-id-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra ID test user](#assign-the-microsoft-entra-id-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure iManage Work (SAML) SSO](#configure-imanage-work-saml-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create iManage Work (SAML) test user](#create-imanage-work-saml-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in iManage Work (SAML) that is linked to the Microsoft Entra ID representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

   1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure iManage Work (SAML) SSO

To configure single sign-on on **iManage Work (SAML)** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Microsoft Entra admin center to [iManage Work (SAML) support team](mailto:cloudsupport@imanage.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides. For more information, please refer this [document.](https://docs.imanage.com/cloud/cc-help/en-US/SAML_Single_Sign-On_(SSO).html)

### Create iManage Work (SAML) test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in iManage Work (SAML). Work withÂ [iManage Work (SAML) support team](mailto:cloudsupport@imanage.com) to add the users in the iManage Work (SAML) platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.
 
#### SP initiated:
 
* Click on **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center. This will redirect to iManage Work (SAML) Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  
 
* Go to iManage Work (SAML) Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.
 
#### IDP initiated:
 
* Click on **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center and you should be automatically signed in to the iManage Work (SAML) for which you set up the SSO.
 
You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the iManage Work (SAML) tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the iManage Work (SAML) for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure iManage Work (SAML) you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization's sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
