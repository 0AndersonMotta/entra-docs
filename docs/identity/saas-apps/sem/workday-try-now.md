## What can you do with Box and Azure AD?

- **Automate user provisioning** - Automatically assign applications to employees based on their group, role, or other attributes in Workday.
- **Synchronize employee profiles** - Ensure employee data stays up-to-date between Azure AD and Workday.
- **Simplify onboarding and offboarding** - Automatically provision user accounts for new hires so they can be productive on day one and decrease security risks by automatically de-provisioning user accounts when employees leave.
- **Easy single sign-on** Eliminate username and passwords and allow users to sign in using their organizational accounts hosted in Azure AD.

## Get started

Set up [user provisioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/Workday-provisioning-tutorial) and [single sign-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/Workday-tutorial) for Workday with our easy configuration guides.
