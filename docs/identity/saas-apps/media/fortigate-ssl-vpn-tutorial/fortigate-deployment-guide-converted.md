# FortiGate deployment guide

Using this deployment guide, you learn how to configure single sign-on between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and FortiGate SSL VPN.

## Redeem the FortiGate license

The Fortinet FortiGate next-generation firewall product is available as a virtual machine in Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS). There are two licensing modes for this virtual machine: pay-as-you-go and bring-your-own-license.

Fortinet might provide members of the Azure AD "Get to Production Secure Hybrid Access (SHA)" team with licenses. In cases where no license has been provided, the pay-as-you-go deployment will also work.

If a license has been issued, Fortinet provides a registration code that must be redeemed online.

1. Register at https://support.fortinet.com/.
2. After registration, sign-in at https://support.fortinet.com/.
3. Go to **Asset** > **Register/Activate**.
4. Enter the registration code provided by Fortinet.
5. Specify the registration code, select **The product will be used by a non-government user**,
    and select **Next**.
6. Enter a product description (for example, FortiGate), set the Fortinet partner as **Other** > **Microsoft**, and select **Next**.
7. Accept the **Fortinet Product Registration Agreement**, and select **Next**.
8. Accept the **Terms** and select **Confirm**.
9. Select the **License File Download**, and save the license for later.


## Download firmware

The Fortinet FortiGate Azure VM doesn't currently ship with the firmware version
needed for SAML authentication. The latest version must be obtained from Fortinet.

1. Sign-in at https://support.fortinet.com/.
2. Go to **Download** > **Firmware Images**.
3. To the right of **Release Notes**, select **Download**.
4. Select **v6.** > **6.** > **6.4.**.
5. Download **FGT_VM64_AZURE-v6-build1637-FORTINET.out** by selecting the **HTTPS** link on the same row.
6. Save the file for later.


## Deploy the FortiGate VM

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com, and sign in to the subscription into which you want to
    deploy the FortiGate Virtual Machine.
2. Create a new resource group, or open the resource group into which you want to deploy
    the FortiGate Virtual Machine.
3. Select **Add**.
4. In **Search the Marketplace**, enter *Forti*. Select **Fortinet FortiGate Next-Generation Firewall**.
5. Select the software plan (bring-your-own-license if you have a license, or pay-as-you-go if not). Select **Create**.
6. Populate the VM configuration.

    ![Screenshot of Create a virtual machine.](virtual-machine.png)

7. Set **Authentication type** to **Password**, and provide administrative credentials for the VM.
8. Select **Review + Create** > **Create**.
9. Wait for the VM deployment to complete.


### Set a static Public IP address and assign a fully qualified domain name

For a consistent user experience, set the Public IP address assigned to the FortiGate VM to be statically assigned. In addition, map it to a fully qualified domain name.

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com, and open the settings for the FortiGate VM.
2. On the **Overview** screen, select the public IP address.

    ![Screenshot of Fortigate SSL VPN.](public-ip-address.png)

3. Select **Static** > **Save**.

If you own a publicly routable domain name for the environment into which the FortiGate VM is
being deployed, create a Host (A) record for the VM. This record maps to the preceding Public IP address that is statically assigned.

### Create a new inbound network security group rule for TCP port

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com, and open the settings for the FortiGate VM.
2. In the menu on the left, select **Networking**. The network interface is listed, and the inbound port rules are shown.
3. Select **Add inbound port rule**.
4. Create a new inbound port rule for TCP 8443.

    ![Screenshot of Add inbound security rule.](port-rule.png)

5. Select **Add**.


## Create a custom Azure app for FortiGate

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com, and open the Azure AD pane for the
    tenant that will provide the identity for FortiGate sign-ins.
2. In the left menu, select **Enterprise Applications**.
3. Select **New Application** > **Non-gallery application**.
4. Enter a name (for example, FortiGate), and select **Add**.
5. In the left menu, select **Users and groups**.
6. Add users who will be able to sign in, and select **Assign**.
7. In the left menu, select **Single sign-on**.
8. Select **SAML**.
9. Under **Basic SAML Configuration**, select the pencil icon to edit the configuration.
10. Configure the following:
    - **Identifier (Entity ID)** to be `https://<address>/remote/saml/metadata`.
    - **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** to be
       `https://<address>/remote/saml/login`.
    - **Logout URL** to be `https://<address>/remote/saml/logout`.

    `<address>` is the FQDN or the public IP address assigned to the FortiGate VM.

11. Record each of these URLs for later use: Entity ID, Reply URL, and Logout URL.
12. Select **Save**, and close **Basic SAML Configuration**.
13. Under **3 – SAML Signing Certificate**, download **Certificate (Base64)** and save it for later.
14. Under **4 – Set up (App Name)**, copy the Azure Login URL, Azure AD Identifier, and Azure
Logout URL, and save them for later.
15. Under **2 – User Attributes and Claims**, select the pencil icon to edit the configuration.
16. Select **Add new claim**, and set the name to **username**.
17. Set the source attribute to **user.userprincipalname**.
18. Select **Save** > **Add a group claim** > **All groups**.
19. Select **Customize the name of the group claim**, and set the name to **group**.
20. Select **Save**.


## Prepare for group matching

FortiGate allows for different user portal experiences after sign-in, based on group membership. For example, there might be one experience for the marketing group and another for the finance group. Here's how you create groups for users:

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com, and open the Azure AD pane for the
    tenant that will provide the identity for FortiGate sign-ins.
2. Select **Groups** > **New Group**.
3. Create a group with the following details:
    - Group type = Security
    - Group name = `a meaningful name`
    - Group description = `a meaningful description for the group`
    - Membership type = Assigned
    - Members = `users for the user experience that will map to this group`
4. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for any additional user experiences.
5. After you create the groups, select each group and record the **Object ID** for each one.
6. Save these object IDs and group names for later.


## Configure the FortiGate VM

The following sections walk you through how to set up the Fortigate VM.

### Install the license

1. Go to `https://<address>`. Here, `<address>` is the FQDN or the public IP address assigned to the FortiGate VM.

2. Continue past any certificate errors.
3. Sign in by using the administrator credentials provided during the FortiGate VM deployment.
4. If the deployment uses the bring-your-own-license model, you'll see a prompt to upload a license. Select the license file created earlier, and upload it. Select **OK** and restart the FortiGate VM.

    ![Screenshot of Fortigate VM License.](license.png)

    For the next step, the URLs recorded earlier will be required. Namely –

    - Entity ID
    - Reply URL
    - Logout URL
    - Azure Login URL
    - Azure AD Identifier
    - Azure Logout URL
4. At the Serial Console, execute the following commands –

    ```
    config user saml

    set user-name username
    set group-name group
    end
    ```
    > [!NOTE]
    > The Azure Logout URL contains a? character. This requires a special key sequence in
    order for it to be correctly provided to the FortiGate Serial Console. The URL is typically-

    `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/wsfederation?wa=wsignout1`

    To provide this in the Serial Console, proceed by typing

    ```
    set idp-single-logout-url https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/wsfederation
    ```
    Then type CTRL+V,

    Then paste the rest of the URL in to complete the line

    ```
    set idp-single-logout-url
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/wsfederation?wa=wsignout1.
