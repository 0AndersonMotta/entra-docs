# Using Azure Front Door to achieve geo-acceleration

This article explains how to configure Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Application Proxy to work with Azure Front Door (AFD) to achieve reduce latency and better performance.
 
## What is Azure Front Door?

Azure Front Door helps deliver low-latency, high-throughput content at scale from the cloud or on-premises infrastructure to users anywhere. Accelerate static and dynamic content delivery with a unified platform built on the massively scalable Microsoft private global network. For more information about Azure Front Door, see [What is Azure Front Door?][front-door-overview].

## Deployment steps

This article guides you through the steps to securely expose a web application on the Internet, by integrating the Azure AD Application Proxy with Azure Front Door. In this guide we'll be using the Azure portal. The reference architecture for this deployment is represented below.

## Prerequisites

- A Front Door Service – Standard or Classic tier
- Apps that exist in a single region.
- A custom domain to use for the application.

### Application Proxy Configuration.

Follow these steps to configure Application Proxy for Front Door: 
1.	Install connector for the location that your app instances will be in (For example US West).  For the connector group assign the connector to the right region (For example North America).
2.	Set up your app instance with Application Proxy as follows:
   a.	Set the Internal URL to the address users access the app from the internal network, for example contoso.org
   b.	Set the External URL to the domain address you want the users to access the app from. For this you must configure a custom domain for our application here , for example, contoso.org. Reference: Custom domains in Azure Active Directory Application Proxy | Microsoft Docs
   c.	Assign the application to the appropriate connector group (For example: North America)
   d.	Note down the URL generated by Application Proxy to access the application. For example, contoso.msappproxy.net 
   e.	For the application configure a CNAME Entry in your DNS provider which points the external URL to the Front Door’s endpoint, for example ‘contoso.org’ to contoso.msappproxy.net 
3.	In the Front Door service, utilize the URL generated for the app by Application Proxy as a backend for the backend pool. For example, contoso.msappproxy.net 

#### Sample Application Proxy Configuration.
The following table shows a sample Application Proxy configuration. The sample scenario uses the sample application domain www.contoso.org as the External URL. 
	Configuration	Additional Information
Internal URL	nam.contoso.com 

External URL	contoso.org	Configure a custom domain for users to access the app from.
Connector Group	North America	Select the connector group in the geo closest to where the app instance will be in for optimized performance.
