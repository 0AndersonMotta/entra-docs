# Conditional Access: Grant

Within a Conditional Access policy, an administrator can make use of access controls to either grant or block access to resources.

## Block access

Block takes into account any assignments and prevents access based on the Conditional Access policy configuration.

Block is a powerful control that should be wielded with appropriate knowledge. It is something administrators should use [Report-only mode](concept-conditional-access-report-only.md) to test before enabling.
