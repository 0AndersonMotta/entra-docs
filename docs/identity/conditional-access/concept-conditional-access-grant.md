# Conditional Access: Grant

Within a Conditional Access policy, an administrator can make use of access controls to either grant or block access to resources.

## Block access

Block takes into account any assignments and prevents access based on the Conditional Access policy configuration.

Block is a powerful control that should be wielded with appropriate knowledge. It is something administrators should use [Report-only mode](concept-conditional-access-report-only.md) to test before enabling.

## Grant access

Administrators can choose to enforce one or more controls when granting access. These controls include the following options: 

- [Require multi-factor authentication (Azure Multi-Factor Authentication)](../authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks.md)
- [Require device to be marked as compliant (Microsoft Intune)](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started)
- [Require hybrid Azure AD joined device](../devices/concept-azure-ad-join-hybrid.md)
- [Require approved client app](app-based-conditional-access.md)
- [Require app protection policy](app-protection-based-conditional-access.md)

When administrators choose to combine these options, they can choose the following methods:

- Require all the selected controls (control **AND** control)
- Require one of the selected controls (control **OR** control)

By default Conditional Access requires all selected controls.
