# Conditional Access policy templates

Baseline protection policies are great but many organizations need more flexibility than they offer. For example, many organizations need the ability to exclude specific accounts like their emergency access or break-glass administration accounts from Conditional Access policies requiring multi-factor authentication. For those organizations the template policies referenced in this article can be of use.

## Typical policies deployed by organizations

* [Require Administrators to perform multi-factor authentication](howto-conditional-access-policy-admin-mfa.md)
* [Require multi-factor authentication when using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the Azure CLI](howto-conditional-access-policy-azure-mamgement.md)
* [Block legacy authentication protocols](howto-conditional-access-policy-block-legacy.md)
* [Block risky sign-ins (Requires Azure AD Premium P2)](howto-conditional-access-policy-risk.md)
* [Require trusted location for security information registration](howto-conditional-access-policy-registration.md)
* [Block access by location](howto-conditional-access-policy-location.md)
