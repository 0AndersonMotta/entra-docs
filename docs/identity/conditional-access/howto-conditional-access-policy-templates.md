# Conditional Access policy templates

Baseline protection policies are great but many organizations need more flexibility than they offer.

## Typical policies deployed by organizations

* [Require Administrators to perform multi-factor authentication](howto-conditional-access-policy-admin-mfa.md)
* [Require multi-factor authentication when using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the Azure CLI](howto-conditional-access-policy-azure-mamgement.md)
* [Block legacy authentication protocols](howto-conditional-access-policy-block-legacy.md)
* [Block risky sign-ins (Requires Azure AD Premium P2)](howto-conditional-access-policy-risk.md)
* Require trusted location for security information registration
