# Conditional Access: Cloud apps, actions, and authentication  context

Cloud apps, actions, and authentication context are key signals in a Conditional Access policy. Conditional Access policies allow administrators to assign controls to specific applications, actions, or authentication context.

- Administrators can choose from the list of applications that include built-in Microsoft applications and any [Azure AD integrated applications](../manage-apps/what-is-application-management.md) including gallery, non-gallery, and applications published through [Application Proxy](../manage-apps/what-is-application-proxy.md).
- Administrators may choose to define policy not based on a cloud application but on a [user action](#user-actions) like **Register security information** or **Register or join devices (Preview)**, allowing Conditional Access to enforce controls around those actions.
- Administrators can use [authentication context](#authentication-context-preview) to provide an additional layer of security inside of applications.

## Microsoft cloud applications

Many of the existing Microsoft cloud applications are included in the list of applications you can select from. 

Administrators can assign a Conditional Access policy to the following cloud apps from Microsoft. Some apps like Office 365 and Microsoft Azure Management include multiple related child apps or services. The following list is not exhaustive and is subject to change.

- [Office 365](#office-365)
- Azure Analysis Services
- Azure DevOps
- [Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics](../../azure-sql/database/conditional-access-configure.md)
- Dynamics CRM Online
- Microsoft Application Insights Analytics
- [Microsoft Azure Information Protection](/azure/information-protection/faqs#i-see-azure-information-protection-is-listed-as-an-available-cloud-app-for-conditional-accesshow-does-this-work)
- [Microsoft Azure Management](#microsoft-azure-management)
- Microsoft Azure Subscription Management
- Microsoft Cloud App Security
- Microsoft Commerce Tools Access Control Portal
- Microsoft Commerce Tools Authentication Service
- Microsoft Flow
- Microsoft Forms
- Microsoft Intune
- [Microsoft Intune Enrollment](/intune/enrollment/multi-factor-authentication)

### Office 365

Microsoft 365 provides cloud-based productivity and collaboration services like Exchange, SharePoint, and Microsoft Teams. Microsoft 365 cloud services are deeply integrated to ensure smooth and collaborative experiences. This integration can cause confusion when creating policies as some apps such as Microsoft Teams have dependencies on others such as SharePoint or Exchange.

The Office 365 app makes it possible to target these services all at once. We recommend using the new Office 365 app, instead of targeting individual cloud apps to avoid issues with [service dependencies](service-dependencies.md). Targeting this group of applications helps to avoid issues that may arise due to inconsistent policies and dependencies.

Administrators can choose to exclude specific apps from policy if they wish by including the Office 365 app and excluding the specific apps of their choice in policy.

Key applications that are included in the Office 365 client app:

   - Microsoft Flow
   - Microsoft Forms
   - Microsoft Stream
   - Microsoft To-Do
   - Microsoft Teams
   - Exchange Online
   - SharePoint Online
   - Microsoft 365 Search Service
   - Yammer
   - Office Delve
   - Office Online
   - Office.com
   - OneDrive
   - PowerApps
   - Skype for Business Online
   - Sway

### Microsoft Azure Management

The Microsoft Azure Management application includes multiple underlying services. 

   - Azure portal
   - Azure Resource Manager provider
   - Classic deployment model APIs
   - Azure PowerShell
   - Azure CLI
   - Visual Studio subscriptions administrator portal
   - Azure DevOps
   - Azure Data Factory portal

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Azure Management application applies to Azure PowerShell, which calls the Azure Resource Manager API. It does not apply to Azure AD PowerShell, which calls Microsoft Graph.

### Other applications

In addition to the Microsoft apps, administrators can add any Azure AD registered application to Conditional Access policies. These applications may include: 

- Applications published through [Azure AD Application Proxy](../manage-apps/what-is-application-proxy.md)
- [Applications added from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md)
- [Custom applications not in the gallery](../manage-apps/view-applications-portal.md)
- [Legacy applications published through app delivery controllers and networks](../manage-apps/secure-hybrid-access.md)
- Applications that use [password based single sign-on](../manage-apps/configure-password-single-sign-on-non-gallery-applications.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Since Conditional Access policy sets the requirements for accessing a service you are not able to apply it to a client (public/native) application. Other words the policy is not set directly on a client (public/native) application, but is applied when a client calls a service. For example, a policy set on SharePoint service applies to the clients calling SharePoint. A policy set on Exchange applies to the attempt to access the email using Outlook client. That is why client (public/native) applications are not available for selection in the Cloud Apps picker and Conditional Access option is not available in the application settings for the client (public/native) application registered in your tenant. 

## User actions

User actions are tasks that can be performed by a user. The only currently supported action is **Register security information**, which allows Conditional Access policy to be enforced when users who are enabled for combined registration attempt to register their security information. More information can be found in the article, [Combined security information registration](../authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined.md).

## Authentication context (Preview)

Authentication context can be used to further secure data and actions in applications. These applications can be your own custom applications, custom line of business (LOB) applications, applications like SharePoint, features like Privileged Identity Management, or applications protected by Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS). 

For example, an organization may keep different files in SharePoint like the lunch menu or their secret BBQ sauce recipe. Everyone may have access to the lunch menu, but users who have access to the secret BBQ sauce recipe may need to access from a managed device and agree to specific terms of use.

### Configure authentication contexts

Authentication contexts are managed in the Azure portal under **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Conditional Access** > **Authentication context**.

![Manage authentication context in the Azure portal](./media/concept-conditional-access-cloud-apps/conditional-access-authentication-context-get-started.png)

> [!WARNING]
> * Deleting authentication context definitions is not possible during the preview. 
> * The preview is limited to a total of 25 authentication context definitions in the Azure portal.

Create new authentication context definitions by selecting **New authentication context** in the Azure portal. Configure the following attributes:

- **Display name** is the name that is used to identify the authentication context in Azure AD and across applications that consume authentication contexts. We recommend names that can be used across resources, like “trusted devices”, to reduce the number of authentication contexts needed. Having a reduced set limits the number of redirects and provides a better end to end user experience.
- **Description** provides more information about the policies it is used by Azure AD administrators and those applying authentication contexts to resources.
- **Publish to apps** checkbox when checked, advertises the authentication context to apps and makes them available to be assigned. If not checked the authentication context will be unavailable to downstream resources. 
- **ID** is read-only and used in tokesn and apps for request specific authentication context definitions. It is listed here for troubleshooting and development use cases. 

For an example policy using authentication context see the article, [Conditional Access: Authentication context with Privileged Identity Management](howto-conditional-access-policy-authentication-context.md).

### Add to Conditional Access policy

Administrators can add configured authentication contexts to a Conditional Access policy by selecting it under **Assignments** > **Cloud apps or actions** > **Authentication context**.

### Tag resources with authentication contexts 

For more information about authentication context use in applications, see the following articles.

- Privileged Identity Management
- SharePoint Online
- Microsoft Cloud App Security
- Custom applications
