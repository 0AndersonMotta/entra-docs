# How To: Require approved client apps for cloud app access with Conditional Access 

Employees regularly use mobile devices for both personal and work tasks. While making sure your employees can be productive, you also want to prevent data loss. With Conditional Access, you can restrict access approved client apps on compliant devices to protect your organization's data.  

This article presents four scenarios to configure Conditional Access policies for resources like Exchange Online and SharePoint Online. 

- [Scenario 1: Exchange Online require approved client app](#scenario-1-exchange-online-require-approved-client-app)
- [Scenario 2: Exchange Online and SharePoint Online require approved client app](#scenario-2-exchange-online-and-sharepoint-online-require-approved-client-app)
- [Scenario 3: Exchange Online and SharePoint Online require approved client app OR compliant device](#scenario-3-exchange-online-and-sharepoint-online-require-approved-client-app-or-compliant-device)
- [Scenario 4: Exchange Online and SharePoint Online require approved client app AND compliant device](#scenario-4-exchange-online-and-sharepoint-online-require-approved-client-app-and-compliant-device)

## Overview

With [Azure AD Conditional Access](overview.md), you can fine-tune how authorized users can access your resources. For example, you can limit the access to your cloud apps to trusted devices.

You can use [Intune app protection policies](/intune/app-protection-policy) to help protect your company’s data. Intune app protection policies don't require mobile-device management (MDM) solution, which enables you to protect your company’s data with or without enrolling devices in a device management solution.

Azure Active Directory Conditional Access enables you to limit access to your cloud apps to client apps that support Intune app protection policies. Like restricting access to Exchange Online to the Outlook app.

In Conditional Access, this functionality is known as requiring an approved client app. For a list of approved client apps, see [approved client app requirement](concept-conditional-access-grant.md).

## Scenario 1: Exchange Online require approved client app

Contoso has decided that all mail on mobile or ActiveSync clients must use an approved client app like Outlook mobile. All of their users already sign in with Azure AD credentials and have licenses assigned to them that include Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 and Microsoft Intune.
