## 1.5.612.0

### Release status

9/20/2018: Released for download

### New features and improvements

- Added WebSocket support for the QlikSense application. To learn more about how to integrate QlikSense with Application Proxy, see this [walkthrough](application-proxy-qlik.md). 
- Improved the installation wizard to make it easier to configure an outbound proxy. 
- Set TLS 1.2 as the default protocol for connectors.

### Fixed issues

## 1.5.402.0

### Release status

1/19/2018: Released for download

### Fixed issues

- Added support for custom domains that need domain translation in the cookie.

## 1.5.132.0

### Release status

5/25/2017: Released for download
### New features and improvements

- Simplified onboarding and management with fewer required ports. Application Proxy now requires opening only two standard outbound ports: 443 and 80. Application Proxy continues to use only outbound connections, so you still don't need any components in a DMZ. For details, see ourâ€¯[configuration documentation](application-proxy-add-on-premises-application.md).  
- If supported by your external proxy or firewall, you can now open your network by DNS instead of IP range. Application Proxy services require connections to *.msappproxy.net and *.servicebus.windows.net only.

## Earlier versions

If you're using Azure AD Application Proxy version 1.5.36.0 or earlier, update to the latest version to ensure you have the latest fully supported features.
