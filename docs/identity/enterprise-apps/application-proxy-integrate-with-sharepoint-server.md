# Enable remote access to SharePoint with Azure AD Application Proxy

This article is a step by step that explains how to integrate an on-premises SharePoint farm with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Application Proxy.

## Prerequisites

To perform the configuration, you need the following:
- A SharePoint 2013 farm or newer.
- An Azure Active Directory tenant with a plan that includes Application Proxy. Learn more about the [possible plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/active-directory/).
- An Application Proxy connector installed and running in the corporate domain.
- The configuration requires 2 URLs:
    - An external URL, visible to end-users and determined in Azure Active Directory. This URL may use a custom domain. Learn more about [Working with custom domains in Azure AD Application Proxy](application-proxy-configure-custom-domain.md).
    - An internal URL, known only within the corporate domain and never used directly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The application pool account of the SharePoint web application must be a domain account for Kerberos to work correctly.
> - To ensure that the links are mapped correctly, follow these recommendations for the internal URL:
>     - Use HTTPS
>     - Do not use custom ports
>     - In the corporate DNS, create a Host (A) to point to the SharePoint WFE (or load balancer), and not an Alias (CName)

In this article, the following values will be used:
- Internal URL: `https://sharepoint`
- External URL: `https://spsites-yvandev.msappproxy.net/`
- Application pool account for the SharePoint web application: `Contoso\spapppool`

## Step 1: Configure Azure AD Proxy

In this step you create an application in you Azure Azure Active Directory tenant that will use Application Proxy. You will set the external URL and specify the internal URL, used later in SharePoint.

1. Create the app as described with the following settings. For step-by-step instructions, see [Publishing applications using Azure AD Application Proxy](application-proxy-add-on-premises-application.md#add-an-on-premises-app-to-azure-ad).
   * **Internal URL**: SharePoint Internal URL that will be set later in SharePoint, such as `https://sharepoint`.
   * **Pre-authentication Method**: Azure Active Directory
   * **Translate URL in Headers**: No
   * **Translate URL in Application Body**: No

   ![Publish SharePoint as application](./media/application-proxy-integrate-with-sharepoint-server/publish-app.png)

1. Once your app is published, configure the single sign-on settings with the following steps:

   1. On the application page in the portal, select **Single sign-on**.
   1. For Single Sign-on Mode, select **Integrated Windows Authentication**.
   1. Set Internal Application SPN to the value that you set earlier. For this example, that would be `HTTP/SharePoint`.
   1. In "Delegated Login Identity", select the most suitable option for your Active Directory forest configuration. For example if you have a single AD domain in your forest, select **On-premises SAM account name** (as shown below), but if your users are not in the same domain as SharePoint and the App Proxy Connector servers then select **On-premises user principal name** (not shown).

   ![Configure Integrated Windows Authentication for SSO](./media/application-proxy-integrate-with-sharepoint-server/configure-iwa.png)

1. To finish setting up your application, go to the **Users and groups** section and assign users to access this application. 

## Step 2: Configure SharePoint web application to use Kerberos and Azure AD Proxy URLs

The SharePoint web application needs to be configured with Kerberos and the appropriate alternate access mappings to work correctly with Azure AD Application Proxy. There are 2 possible options:

1. Create a new web application and use only default zone. This is the preferred option to have the best experience with SharePoint (for example, links in the email alerts always point to default zone).
1. Extend an existing web application to configure Kerberos on a non-default zone.

- If you decide to create a new web application and use only Default zone (preferred option):

    1. Start the **SharePoint Management Shell** and run the following script:

       ```powershell
       # This scripts create a web application and configure Default zone with the internal/external URL needed to work with Azure AD Application Proxy
       # Edit variables below to fit your environment. Note that the managed account must exist and it must be a domain account
       $internalUrl = "https://sharepoint"
       $externalUrl = "https://spsites-yvandev.msappproxy.net/"
       $applicationPoolManagedAccount = "Contoso\spapppool"
            
       $winAp = New-SPAuthenticationProvider -UseWindowsIntegratedAuthentication -DisableKerberos:$false
       $wa = New-SPWebApplication -Name "SharePoint - AAD Proxy" -Port 443 -SecureSocketsLayer -URL $externalUrl -ApplicationPool "SharePoint - AAD Proxy" -ApplicationPoolAccount (Get-SPManagedAccount $applicationPoolManagedAccount) -AuthenticationProvider $winAp
       New-SPAlternateURL -Url $internalUrl -WebApplication $wa -Zone Default -Internal
       ```

    1. Open the **SharePoint Central Administration** site.
    1. Under **System Settings**, select **Configure Alternate Access Mappings**. The Alternate Access Mappings box opens.
    1. Filter the display with the new web application and confirm you see something like this:

   ![Shows the Alternate Access Mappings box](./media/application-proxy-integrate-with-sharepoint-server/new-webapp-aam.png)

- If you decide to extend an existing web application to a new zone (in case you cannot use the Default zone):

    1. Start the **SharePoint Management Shell** and run the following script:

       ```powershell
       # This scripts extends an existing web application to Internet zone with the internal/external URL needed to work with Azure AD Application Proxy
       # Edit variables below to fit your environment
       $webAppUrl = "http://spsites2019/"
       $internalUrl = "https://sharepoint"
       $externalUrl = "https://spsites-yvandev.msappproxy.net/"
       
       $winAp = New-SPAuthenticationProvider -UseWindowsIntegratedAuthentication -DisableKerberos:$false
       $wa = Get-SPWebApplication $webAppUrl
       New-SPWebApplicationExtension -Name "SharePoint - AAD Proxy" -Identity $wa -SecureSocketsLayer -Zone Extranet -Url $externalUrl -AuthenticationProvider $winAp
       New-SPAlternateURL -Url $internalUrl -WebApplication $wa -Zone Extranet -Internal
       ```

    1. Open the **SharePoint Central Administration** site.
    1. Under **System Settings**, select **Configure Alternate Access Mappings**. The Alternate Access Mappings box opens.
    1. Filter the display with the web application that was extended and confirm you see something like this:

    ![Correct Alternate Access Mappings](./media/application-proxy-integrate-with-sharepoint-server/alternate-access3.png)

## Step 3: Ensure that an HTTPS certificate is configured for the IIS site of the Extranet zone

SharePoint configuration is now finished, but since the Internal URL of the Extranet zone is <https://SharePoint/>, a certificate must be set for this site.

1. Open Windows PowerShell console.
1. Run the following script to generate a self-signed certificate and add it to the computer MY store:

   ```powershell
   # Replace "SharePoint" with the actual hostname of the Internal URL of your Azure AD proxy application
   New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "SharePoint" -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My"
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Self-signed certificates are suitable only for test purposes. In production environments, it is strongly recommended to use certificates issued by a certificate authority instead.

1. Open "Internet Information Services Manager" console.
1. Expand the server in the tree view, expand "Sites", select the site "SharePoint - AAD Proxy" and click on **Bindings**.
1. Select https binding and click **Edit...**.
1. In SSL certificate field, choose **SharePoint** certificate and click OK.

You can now access the SharePoint site externally via Azure AD Application Proxy.


## Step 1: Configure Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD)

For on-premises applications that use Windows authentication, you can achieve single sign-on (SSO) with the Kerberos authentication protocol and a feature called Kerberos constrained delegation (KCD). KCD, when configured, allows the Application Proxy connector to obtain a Windows token for a user, even if the user hasnâ€™t signed in to Windows directly. To learn more about KCD, see [Kerberos Constrained Delegation Overview](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj553400.aspx).

To set up KCD for a SharePoint server, use the procedures in the following sequential sections:

### Ensure that SharePoint web application is running under a domain account

First, make sure that the SharePoint web application is running under a domain account--not local system, local service, or network service. Do this so that you can attach service principal names (SPNs) to this account. SPNs are how the Kerberos protocol identifies different services. And you will need the account later to configure the KCD.

> [!NOTE]
> You need to have a previously created Azure AD account for the service. We suggest that you allow for an automatic password change. For more information about the full set of steps and troubleshooting issues, see [Configure automatic password change in SharePoint](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff724280.aspx).

To ensure that your sites are running under a defined service account, perform the following steps:

1. Open the **SharePoint Central Administration** site.
1. Go to **Security** and select **Configure service accounts**.
1. Select **Web Application Pool - SharePoint - 80**. The options may be slightly different based on the name of your web pool, or if the web pool uses SSL by default.

   ![Choices for configuring a service account](./media/application-proxy-integrate-with-sharepoint-server/service-web-application.png)

1. If **Select an account for this component** field is set to **Local Service** or **Network Service**, you need to create an account. If not, you're finished and can move to the next section.
1. Select **Register new managed account**. After your account is created, you must set **Web Application Pool** before you can use the account.

### Set a service principal name for the SharePoint service account

Before you configure KCD, you need to:

* Identify the domain account running the SharePoint web application that Azure AD Proxy will expose.
* Choose an Internal URL that will be configured in both Azure AD Proxy and SharePoint. This Internal URL must not already be used in the web application, and will never appear in the web browser.

Assuming the internal URL chosen is <https://sharepoint>, then the SPN is `HTTP/SharePoint`


To register this SPN, run the following command from the command prompt as an administrator of the domain:

`setspn -S HTTP/SharePoint demo\spAppPoolAccount`

This command sets the SPN _HTTP/SharePoint_ for the SharePoint application pool account _demo\spAppPoolAccount_.

Replace _HTTP/SharePoint_ with the SPN for your internal URL and _demo\spAppPoolAccount_ with the application pool account in your environment. The Setspn command searches for the SPN before it adds it. In it already exists, you will see a **Duplicate SPN Value** error. In this case, consider to remove the existing SPN if it's not set under the correct application pool account.

You can verify that the SPN was added by running the Setspn command with the -L option. To learn more about this command, see [Setspn](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc731241.aspx).

### Ensure that the connector is trusted for delegation to the SPN added to the SharePoint application pool account

Configure the KCD so that the Azure AD Application Proxy service can delegate user identities to the SharePoint application pool account. Configure KCD by enabling the Application Proxy connector to retrieve Kerberos tickets for your users who have been authenticated in Azure AD. Then that server passes the context to the target application, or SharePoint in this case.

To configure the KCD, repeat the following steps for each connector machine:

1. Log in as a domain administrator to a DC, and then open **Active Directory Users and Computers**.
1. Find the computer that the connector is running on. In this example, it's the same SharePoint server.
1. Double-click the computer, and then click the **Delegation** tab.
1. Ensure that the delegation settings are set to **Trust this computer for delegation to the specified services only**. Then, select **Use any authentication protocol**.
1. Click the **Add** button, click **Users or Computers**, and locate the SharePoint application pool account, for example _demo\spAppPoolAccount_.
1. In the list of SPNs, select the one that you created earlier for the service account.
1. Click **OK**. Click **OK** again to save the changes.
