# What is application management in Azure Active Directory?

Azure AD is a cloud solution for managing user access to applications. You can use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to manage user access to Office 365 as well as every business application from Microsoft, thousands of software as a service (SaaS) applications, on-premises applications, and line of business (LOB) apps. When application access is managed with Azure AD, users can sign on to any application by using their Azure AD accounts. After a single sign-on, users can access the other applications without signing in again.

## Why manage applications with a cloud solution?

Organizations often have hundreds of applications that users depend on to get their work done. Users access these applications from a variety of devices and locations. In addition, new apps are added, developed, and sunset every day. With so many applications and access points, it is more critical than ever to use a cloud-based solution to manage user access to all applications.

## Benefits of using Azure AD for application management

As a cloud solution, Azure AD can help you manage access risks, improve productivity, address governance and compliance needs, while reducing overall costs.

### Manage risk with conditional access policies
Coupling Azure AD single sign-on (SSO) with conditional access policies provides high levels of security for accessing applications. Security capabilities include cloud-scale identity protection, risk-based access control, native multi-factor authentication, and conditional access policies. These capabilities  allow for granular control policies based on applications, or on groups that need higher levels of security.

### Improve productivity with single sign-on
Enabling single sign-on (SSO) across applications and Office 365 provides a superior log in experience for existing users by reducing or eliminating log on prompts. The userâ€™s environment feels more cohesive and is less distracting without multiple prompts, or the need to manage multiple passwords. The business group can manage and approve access through self-service and dynamic membership. Allowing the right people in the business to manage access to an application improves the security of the identity system.

SSO improves security. *Without single sign-on*, administrators need to create and update user accounts for each individual application, which takes time. Also, users have to track multiple credentials to access their applications. As a result, users tend to write down their passwords or use other password management solutions, which introduce data security risks. 



### Address governance and compliance
With Azure AD, you can audit access requests and approvals for the application, as well as understand overall application usage. Azure AD supports native audit logs for every application access request. Auditing data is also available from an API, which enables you to import this data into a Security Incident and Event Monitoring (SIEM) system of choice. You can review which users have access to an application, as well as programmatically remove access for users that haven't accessed the application recently.

### Manage costs
By migrating to Azure AD, you can save costs associated with managing your current infrastructure. Azure AD provides self-service access to applications. Single sign-on eliminates application-specific passwords, which saves costs related to password reset for applications, and lost productivity while retrieving passwords.
