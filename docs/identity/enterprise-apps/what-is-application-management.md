# What is application management?

Azure AD is an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. It provides a single place to store information about digital identities. You can configure your software applications to use Azure AD as the place where user information is stored. 

Azure AD must be configured to integrate with an application. In other words, it needs to know what applications are using it as an identity system. The process of keeping Azure AD aware of these applications, and how it should handle them, is known as application management.

You manage applications on the **Enterprise applications** blade located in the Manage section of the Azure Active Directory portal.

## What is an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system?
An application is a piece of software that is used for some purpose. Most applications require users to sign in so that the application can provide a tailored experience for that particular user. In other words, the application needs to know the identity of the user using the application.

If each application kept track of users separately then the result would be a silo of different usernames and logins for every application. One application wouldn't know anything about the users in other applications.

A centralized identity system solves this problem by providing a single place to store user information that can then be used by all applications. These systems have come to be known as Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems. Azure Active Directory is the IAM system for the Microsoft cloud.

## Why manage applications with a cloud solution?

Organizations often have hundreds of applications that users depend on to get their work done. Users access these applications from many devices and locations. New applications are added, developed, and sunset all the time. With so many applications and access points, it's more critical than ever to use a cloud-based solution to manage user access to all applications.

>[!TIP]
>The Azure AD app gallery contains many popular applications that are already pre-configured to work with Azure AD as an identity provider.

## How does Azure AD work with applications?

Azure AD simplifies the way you manage identities for your cloud and on-premises applications. Users sign in once, called single sign-on (SSO), and then focus on being product with the the apps instead of signing in again for every app. Azure AD sits at the middle of your on-premises apps, cloud based Software as a Service (SaaS) apps, your own custom apps, and other external identity providers.

>[!TIP]
>Reduce administrative costs by [automating user provisioning](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md) so that users are automatically added to Azure AD when you add them to your company HR system. 

## What types of applications can I integrate with Azure AD?

You can use Azure AD as your identity system for just about any app. Many apps are already pre-configured and can be setup with minimal effort. These pre-configured apps are published in the [Azure AD App Gallery](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/). 

If an app is not already pre-configured you can usually still integrate it. Azure AD provides several single sign-on options. Some of the most popular are SAML-based SSO and OIDC-based SSO. To learn more about integrating apps to enable SSO, see [single sign-on options](sso-options.md). 

You can integrate your on-premises and private cloud web apps using Application Proxy. To learn more about Application Proxy, see [Provide remote access to on-premises applications through Azure AD's Application Proxy](application-proxy.md).

>When building your own line-of-business applications, you can integrate them with Azure AD to support single sign-on. To learn more about developing apps for Azure AD, see [Microsoft identity platform](..//develop/v2-overview.md).

## Manage risk with Conditional Access policies

Coupling Azure AD single sign-on (SSO) with [Conditional Access](../conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-cloud-apps.md) provides high levels of security for accessing applications. Security capabilities include cloud-scale identity protection, risk-based access control, native multi-factor authentication, and Conditional Access policies. These capabilities allow for granular control policies based on applications, or on groups that need higher levels of security.

## Improve productivity with single sign-on

Enabling single sign-on (SSO) across applications and Microsoft 365 provides a superior sign-in experience for existing users by reducing or eliminating sign-in prompts. The userâ€™s environment feels more cohesive and is less distracting without multiple prompts, or the need to manage multiple passwords. The business group can manage and approve access through self-service and dynamic membership. Allowing the right people in the business to manage access to an application improves the security of the identity system.

SSO improves security. *Without single sign-on*, administrators need to create and update user accounts for each individual application, which takes time. Also, users have to track multiple credentials to access their applications. As a result, users tend to write down their passwords or use other password management solutions, which introduce data security risks. [Read more about single sign-on](what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Address governance and compliance

With Azure AD, you can monitor application sign-ins through reports that leverage Security Incident and Event Monitoring (SIEM) tools. You can access the reports from the portal, or from APIs. Programmatically audit who has access to your applications, and remove access to inactive users via access reviews.

## Manage costs

By migrating to Azure AD, you can save costs and remove the hassle of managing your on-premises infrastructure. Azure AD also provides self-service access to applications, which saves time for both administrators and users. Single sign-on eliminates application-specific passwords. This ability to sign on once saves costs related to password reset for applications, and lost productivity while retrieving passwords.

For Human Resources focused applications, or other applications with a large set of users, you can leverage App provisioning to automate the process of provisioning and deprovisioning users, see [What is application provisioning?](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
