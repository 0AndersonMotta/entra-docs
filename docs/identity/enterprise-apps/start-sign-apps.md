# Start and sign in to applications in the My Apps portal

You can get to the My Apps portal from any of the following web browsers. Microsoft recommends that you use the most up-to-date browser that's compatible with your operating system.

- Microsoft Edge (latest version, desktop and mobile)
- Safari (latest version, Mac and iOS)
- Chrome (latest version, desktop and mobile)

You can access and use the My Apps portal on your computer, or from the mobile version of the Edge browser on an iOS or Android mobile device.

## Access the My Apps portal on your computer

If you have permission to access and use your organization's cloud-based apps, you can get to them through the My Apps portal.

Sign in to the My Apps portal with your work or school account on your computer. Your organization might direct you to a customized page such as https://myapps.microsoft.com/contoso.com. The My Apps page appears, showing all the cloud-based apps owned by your organization that are available for you to use.

From the My Apps page, select the app you want to start using. A new page opens for the app, where you can sign in (if necessary) or begin using the app.

If your organization has already set you up for single sign-on, the extension is installed automatically and you can skip this section.

- Mozilla Firefox - From the Firefox Add-ons page, go to the My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension feature, and then select Add to Firefox.

An icon is added to the right of your Address bar, letting you sign in and customize the extension.
