# Quickstart: Set up Single Sign-On (SSO) for an application in your Azure AD tenant

Get started with simplified user logins by setting up SSO for an application you have added to your Azure AD tenant. After setting up SSO your users will be able to sign into an application using their Azure AD credentials. SSO is included in the free edition of Azure AD. 

## Prerequisites

To set up SSO for an application you have added to your tenant, you need:

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An application that supports SSO
- (Optional: Completion of [View your apps](view-applications-portal.md))
- (Optional: Completion of [Add an app](add-application-portal.md))
- (Optional: Completion of [Configure an app](add-application-portal-configure.md))


>[!IMPORTANT]
>We recommend using a non-production environment to test the steps in this quickstart.


## Procedure 1

<!---Required:
Quickstarts are prescriptive and guide the customer through an end-to-end procedure.
Make sure to use specific naming for setting up accounts and configuring technology.

Avoid linking off to other content - include whatever the customer needs to complete the
scenario in the article. For example, if the customer needs to set permissions, include the
permissions they need to set, and the specific settings in the quickstart procedure. Don't
send the customer to another article to read about it.

In a break from tradition, do not link to reference topics in the procedural part of the
quickstart when using cmdlets or code. Provide customers what they need to know in the quickstart
to successfully complete the quickstart.

For portal-based procedures, minimize bullets and numbering.

For the CLI or PowerShell based procedures, don't use bullets or numbering.

Be mindful of the number of H2/procedures in the Quickstart. 3-5 procedural steps are about right.
Once you've staged the article, look at the right-hand "In this article" section on the docs page;
if there are more than 8 total, consider restructuring the article.
--->

Include a sentence or two to explain only what is needed to complete the
procedure.

1. Step 1 of the procedure
1. Step 2 of the procedure
1. Step 3 of the procedure
   ![Browser](media/contribute-how-to-mvc-quickstart/browser.png)
   <!---Use screenshots but be judicious to maintain a reasonable length. Make
    sure screenshots align to the
    [current standards](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/contribute-how-to-create-screenshot?branch=master).

   If users access your product/service via a web browser the first screenshot
   should always include the full browser window in Chrome or Safari. This is
   to show users that the portal is browser-based - OS and browser agnostic.--->
1. Step 4 of the procedure

## Procedure 2

Include a sentence or two to explain only what is needed to complete the procedure.

1. Step 1 of the procedure
1. Step 2 of the procedure
1. Step 3 of the procedure

## Procedure 3

Include a sentence or two to explain only what is needed to complete the procedure.
<!---Code requires specific formatting. Here are a few useful examples of
commonly used code blocks. Make sure to use the interactive functionality where
possible.
For the CLI or PowerShell based procedures, don't use bullets or numbering.--->

Here is an example of a code block for Java:

```java
cluster = Cluster.build(new File("src/remote.yaml")).create();
...
client = cluster.connect();
```

or a code block for Azure CLI:

```azurecli 
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM --image win2016datacenter --admin-username azureuser --admin-password myPassword12
```
or a code block for Azure PowerShell:

```azurepowershell
New-AzureRmContainerGroup -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name mycontainer -Image microsoft/iis:nanoserver -OsType Windows -IpAddressType Public
```

<!-- Use the -interactive CLI/PowerShell code fences ONLY if all such commands can be marked that way,
otherwise the reader might run some in the interactive in which case the state isn't determinate. --->

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this application, delete <resources> with the following steps:

1. From the left-hand menu...
2. ...click Delete, type...and then click Delete

<!---Required:
To avoid any costs associated with following the quickstart procedure, a
Clean up resources (H2) should come just before Next steps (H2).

If there is a follow-on quickstart that uses the same resources, make that option clear
so that a reader doesn't need to recreate those resources.
--->

## Next steps

Advance to the next article to learn how to create...
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Next steps button](contribute-get-started-mvc.md)

<!--- Required:
Quickstarts should always have a Next steps H2 that points to the next logical
quickstart in a series, or, if there are no other quickstarts, to some other
cool thing the customer can do. A single link in the blue box format should
direct the customer to the next article - and you can shorten the title in the
boxes if the original one doesnâ€™t fit.
Do not use a "More info section" or a "Resources section" or a "See also section". --->
