# Secure hybrid access: Protect legacy apps with Azure Active Directory

In this article, learn to protect your on-premises and cloud legacy authentication applications by connecting them to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

* **Application Proxy**:
  * Protect users, apps, and data in the cloud and on-premises 
  * Use it to publish on-premises web applications externally
  * [What is Application Proxy?](./app-proxy/application-proxy#what-is-application-proxy)
* **Secure hybrid access through Azure AD partner integrations**:
  * Pre-built solutions
  * Conditional Access policies per application
  * [What is Conditional Access?](../conditional-access/overview.md)
  * Azure AD integration documentation

In addition to Application Proxy, you can strengthen your security posture with Identity Protection.

* [Using Azure AD Application Proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users](../app-proxy/what-is-application-proxy.md)

## Single sign-on and multi-factor authentication

With Azure AD as an identity provider (IdP), you can use modern authentication and authorization methods like single sign-on (SSO) and Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to secure legacy, on-premises applications.

* [What is SSO in Azure Active Directory?](/articles/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md)
* [How it works: Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication](/articles/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks.md)

## Secure hybrid access with Application Proxy

Use Application Proxy for secure remote access to on-premises web applications. Users donâ€™t need to use a virtual private network (VPN); they connect to applications from devices with SSO.

* [Using Azure AD Application Proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users](/articles/active-directory/app-proxy/what-is-application-proxy.md)

### Application publishing and access management

Use Application Proxy remote access as a service to publish applications to users outside the corporate network. Help improve your cloud access management without requiring modification to your on-premises applications.

## Partner integrations for apps: on-premises and legacy authentication

Microsoft partners with various companies that deliver access solutions for on-premises applications, and applications that use legacy authentication. The following diagram illustrates a user flow from sign-in to secure access to apps and data.
