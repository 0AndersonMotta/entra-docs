## Secure your legacy apps by connecting existing app delivery controllers or networks to Azure AD

You can now protect your on-premises and cloud legacy authentication applications with Azure AD by extending your existing application delivery controller or network. With pre-built integrations from partners, you can protect apps that couldn't be protected with Azure AD before. Strengthen your security posture for all apps with Azure AD Conditional Access, Azure AD Identity protection, and other capabilities.

Deploying your applications via your application delivery vendor allows you to protect legacy apps that are still critical to your business processes. With your current deployment, you probably have all you need to start protecting your apps with Azure AD.

The following vendors offer pre-built solutions and detailed guidance for integrating with Azure AD.
