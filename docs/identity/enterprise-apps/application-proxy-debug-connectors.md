# Debug Application Proxy connector issues 

This article helps you troubleshoot issues with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Application Proxy connectors. If you're using the Application Proxy service for remote access to an on-premises web application, but you're having trouble connecting to the application, use this flowchart to debug connector issues. 

## Before you begin

This article assumes you have installed the Application Proxy connector and are having an issue. 

For more information about about Application Proxy and using its connectors, see:

- [Remote access to on-premises applications through Application Proxy](application-proxy.md)
- [Application Proxy connectors](application-proxy-connectors.md)
- [Install and register a connector](application-proxy-add-on-premises-application.md) 

## Flowchart for connector issues

This flowchart walks you through the steps for debugging a connector issue. For details about each step, see the table following the flowchart.

![Flowchart showing steps for debugging a connector](media/application-proxy-debug-connectors/application-proxy-connector-debugging-flowchart.png)

|  | Action | Description | 
|---------|---------|---------|
|1 | Find the connector group assigned to the app | You probably have a connector installed on multiple servers, in which case the connectors should be [assigned to connector groups](application-proxy-connector-groups.md#assign-applications-to-your-connector-groups). To learn more about connector groups, see [Publish applications on separate networks and locations using connector groups](application-proxy-connector-groups.md). |
|2 | Install the connector and assign a group | If you don't have a connector installed, see [Install and register a connector](application-proxy-add-on-premises-application.md#install-and-register-a-connector).<br></br>If the connector is not assigned to a group, see [Assign the connector to a group](application-proxy-connector-groups.md#create-connector-groups).<br></br>If the application is not assigned to a connector group, see [Assign the application to a connector group](application-proxy-connector-groups.md#assign-applications-to-your-connector-groups).|
|3 | Run a port test on the connector server | On the connector server, run a port test by using the [Azure Active Directory Application Proxy Connector Ports Test Tool](https://aadap-portcheck.connectorporttest.msappproxy.net/).|
|4 | Configure the domains and ports | [Make sure that your domains and ports are configured correctly](application-proxy-add-on-premises-application.md#prepare-your-on-premises-environment) For the connector to work properly, there are certain ports that must be open and URLs that your server must be able to access. |
|5 | Load the app's internal URL on the connector server | On the connector server, load the app's internal URL. |
|6 | Check internal network connectivity | There's a connectivity issue in your internal network that this debugging flow is unable to diagnose. The application must be accessible internally for the connectors to work. |
|7 | Lengthen the time-out value on the back end | In the **Additional Settings** for your application, change the **Backend Application Timeout** setting to **Long**. See [Add an on-premises app to Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application#add-an-on-premises-app-to-azure-ad). |
|8 | Check if a back-end proxy is in use | Check to see if the connectors are using back-end proxy servers or bypassing them. For details, see [Troubleshoot connector proxy problems and service connectivity issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-configure-connectors-with-proxy-servers#troubleshoot-connector-proxy-problems-and-service-connectivity-issues). |
|9 | Update the connector and updater to use the back-end proxy | If a back-end proxy is in use, you'll want to make sure the connector is using the same proxy. For details about troubleshooting and configuring connectors to work with proxy servers, see [Work with existing on-premises proxy servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-configure-connectors-with-proxy-servers). |
|10 | Target specific flow issues, review app and SSO debugging flows. | Use the [Debug Application Proxy application issues](application-proxy-debug-apps.md) troubleshooting flow. |
