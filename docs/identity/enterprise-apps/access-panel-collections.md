# Create collections on the My Apps portal

Your users can use the My Apps portal to view and start the cloud-based applications they have access to. By default, all the applications a user can access are listed together on a single page. To better organize this page for your users, if you have an Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 license you can set up collections. With a collection, you can group together applications that are related (for example, by job role, task, or project) and display them on a separate tab. A collection essentially applies a filter to the applications a user can already access, so the user sees only those applications in the collection that have been assigned to them.

> [!NOTE]
> This article covers how an admin can enable and create collections. For information for the end user about how to use the My Apps portal and collections, see [Access and use collections](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/user-help/my-applications-portal-collections).

## Create a collection

To create a collection, you must have an Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 license.

1. Open the [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in as an admin with an Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 license.

2. Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Enterprise Applications**.

3. Under **Manage**, select **Collections)**.

4. Select **New collection**. In the **New collection** page, enter a **Name** for the collection (we recommend not using "collection" in the name. Then enter a **Description**.

5. Select **Review + Create**. The properties for the new collection appear.

6. Select the **Applications** tab. Under **Add applications**, select all the applications you want to add to the collection, or use the **Search** box to find applications. 

7. Select **Add**. The list of selected applications appears. You can use the up and down arrows to change the order of applications in the list.

8. Select the **Users and groups** tab. To add a user or group, select **Add user**. 

9. On the **Select members** page, select the users or groups you want to assign the collection to. Or use the **Search** box to find users or groups.

10. When you're finished selecting users and groups, choose **Select**.

11. To change a user's role from **Read Access** to **Owner** or vice versa, click the current role and select a new role.

## View audit logs

The Audit logs record My Apps collections operations, including collection creation end-user actions. The following events are generated from My Apps:

* Create collection
* Edit collection
* Delete collection
* Launch an application (end user)
* Self-service application adding (end user)
* Self-service application deletion (end user)

You can access audit logs in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by selecting **Azure Active Directory** > **Enterprise Applications** > **Audit logs** in the Activity section. For **Service**, select **My Apps**.

## Get support for My Account pages

From the My Apps page, a user can select **My account** > **View my account** to open their account settings. On the Azure AD **My Account** page, users can manage their security info, devices, passwords, and more. They can also access their Office account settings.

In case you need to submit a support request for an issue with the Azure AD account page or the Office account page, follow these steps so your request is routed properly: 

* For issues with the **Azure AD "My Account"** page, open a support request from within the Azure portal. Go to **Azure portal** > **Azure Active Directory** > **New support request**.

* For issues with the **Office "My account"** page, open a support request from within the Microsoft 365 admin center. Go to **Microsoft 365 admin center** > **Support**.
