# Quick start for inbound provisioning to Azure Active Directory with PowerShell

This document describes how to use PowerShell to configure the inbound provisioning API for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). To perform the steps described in this article, you need either the *Azure AD Application Administrator* or the *Global Administrator* role.  

Using the steps in this guide, you'll convert a CSV file containing HR data into a SCIM bulk request payload and send it to the Azure AD inbound provisioning API endpoint. 

To help you with this process, we provide a sample PowerShell script that you can customize with your requirements. You can download this script from the Inbound Provisioning Private Preview Teams folder(WHAT IS THE PUBLIC PREVIEW, OR GA, FOLDER?).  

## Configure provisioning job for API-based data ingestion 

The following steps successfully configure out-of-the-box provisioning job with default mappings: 

1. Sign in to Microsoft Entra portal with Global Administrator or Application Administrator role credentials.  
1. Browse to **Azure Active Directory** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications**. 
1. Click **New application** to create a new provisioning application to store the configuration for API-driven inbound provisioning. 

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/new-application.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to create a new application.":::

1. Type 'API-driven' in the search text box. Select the application **API-driven Inbound User Provisioning to Azure AD**. 

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/select-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to select the inbound provisioning API application.":::

1. You can rename the application to meet your naming requirements and then click **Create**. 

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/create.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to create an inbound provisioning API application.":::

   >[!TIP]
   >If you plan to ingest data from multiple sources that each have their own sync rules, you can create multiple apps and give each app a descriptive name, such as **API2AAD-Provision-Employees-From-CSV** or **API2AAD-Provision-Contractors**.

1. After the application is created, go to the **Provisioning** blade, the click **Get started**. 

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/get-started.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to get started on the Provisioning blade.":::

1. Switch **Provisioning Mode** from **Manual** to **Automatic**.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/mode.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to switch the provisioning mode.":::

1. Click **Save** to create the initial configuration of the provisioning job.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/save-initial-job.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to save the initial configuration of the job.":::

1. After the operation is saved, you see two more expansion panels: one for Mappings and one for Settings. Before you proceed, make sure you provide a valid notification email ID and **Save** the configuration once more. 

   >[!NOTE]
   >Providing the notification email is mandatory, though the user interface doesn’t require it. Make sure you set a notification email. If the notification email remains empty, the provisioning job goes into quarantine when you start the execution.    

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/email.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to set email notification.":::

1. Click the hyperlink in the Mappings expansion panel to view the default attribute mappings.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >The default configuration in the **Attribute Mappings** page maps SCIM Core User and Enterprise User attributes to Azure AD attributes. We recommend using the default mappings to get started and customizing these mappings later as you get more familiar with the overall data flow. For more information about customization, see [NEED UPDATED LINK](###). 

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/attribute-mapping.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to set attribute mapping.":::

1. Click the provisioning app name to navigate back to the Provisioning blade landing page.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/navigate.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to navigate to provisioning app name.":::

1. On the Provisioning App Landing page, you see the following information and controls.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/provisioning-controls.png" alt-text="Screenshot of provisioning controls.":::

   >[!TIP]
   >First time users, before you click **Start provisioning**, copy the HTTPS URL value shown under Provisioning API endpoint and follow the instructions in Invoke the API in Graph Explorer with a user account to post data to the API endpoint. After the POST operation succedes, then come back and click **Start provisioning**. By following this step, you should immediately see processing results in less than 5 minutes, and you can then go to the section: Verify processing from Microsoft Entra portal. 

   | Control | Description |
   |---------|-------------|
   | **Start provisioning** | Place the provisioning job in **listen mode**. In the **Start** state, the provisioning job wakes up every 40 minutes and checks if any SCIM bulk request payloads need to be processed. |
   | **Stop provisioning** | Pause or stop the provisioning job. |
   | **Restart provisioning** | Purge any SCIM payloads that are pending processing, and start a new provisioning cycle. |
   | **Edit provisioning** | Edit the job settings, attribute mappings, and customize the SCIM schema. |
   | **Provision on demand** | Not yet enabled. |
   | **Provisioning API endpoint** | Copy the HTTPS URL value shown here and save it in Notepad or OneNote for use later with the API client.|

## Download the CSV2SCIM script

Download the CSV2SCIM PowerShell script and samples.

1. Extract the contents to your local folder. It has the following directory structure:

   **azure-activedirectory-inbound-provisioning**

   - src
     - CSV2SCIM.ps1 (main script)
     - ScimSchemaRepresentations (folder containing standard SCIM schema definitions for validating AttributeMapping.psd1 files)
     - EnterpriseUser.json, Group.json, Schema.json, User.json
   - Samples
     - AttributeMapping.psd1 (sample mapping of columns in CSV file to standard SCIM attributes)
     - csv-with-2-records.csv (sample CSV file with two records)
     - csv-with-1000-records.csv (sample CSV file with 1000 records)
     - Test-ScriptCommands.ps1 (sample usage commands)
     - UseClientCertificate.ps1 (script to generate self-signed certificate and upload it as service principal credential for use in OAuth flow)
     - Sample1 (folder with more examples of how CSV file columns can be mapped to SCIM standard attributes. If you get different CSV files for employees, contractors, interns, you can create a separate AttributeMapping.psd1 file for each entity.)
       
1. Download and install the latest version of PowerShell. 
1. Run the command to enable execution of remote signed scripts: 

   ```powershell
   set-executionpolicy remotesigned
   ```

1. Install the following prerequisite modules:
   
   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Graph.Applications,Microsoft.Graph.Reports
   ```

## Generate SCIM payload with standard schema

In this section, you'll generate a SCIM payload with standard Core User and Enterprise User attribute from a CSV file. 
To illustrate the procedure, you'll use the CSV file ```Samples/csv-with-2-records.csv``` present in the **azure-activedirectory-inbound-provisioning** folder. 


1. Open the CSV file ```Samples/csv-with-2-records.csv``` in Notepad, Excel, or TextPad to check the columns present in the file. 

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/columns.png" alt-text="Screenshot of columns in Excel.":::

1. In Notepad++ or a source code editor like Visual Studio Code, open the PowerShell data file ```Samples/AttributeMapping.psd1``` that enables mapping of CSV file columns to SCIM standard schema elements. The file that's shipped out-of-the-box already has preconfigured mapping of CSV file columns to corresponding SCIM elements. We'll use it as-is for this execution. 
1. Open PowerShell and change to the directory **azure-activedirectory-inbound-provisioning\src**.
1. Run the following command to initialize the AttributeMapping variable. 

   ```powershell
   $AttributeMapping = Import-PowerShellDataFile '..\Samples\AttributeMapping.psd1'
   ```

1. Run the following command to validate if the AttributeMapping specified has valid standard SCIM schema attributes. This command returns **True** if the validation is successful. 

   ```powershell
   .\CSV2SCIM.ps1 -Path '..\Samples\csv-with-2-records.csv' -AttributeMapping $AttributeMapping -ValidateAttributeMapping
   ```

1. Let’s say the AttributeMapping file has an invalid SCIM attribute called **userId**, then the ValidateAttributeMapping mode displays the following error. 

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/mapping-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a mapping error.":::

1. Once you verified that the AttributeMapping is valid, run the following command to generate a SCIM bulk request in the file ```SCIMPayload.json``` that includes the two records present in the CSV file. 


   ```powershell
   .\CSV2SCIM.ps1 -Path '..\Samples\csv-with-2-records.csv' -AttributeMapping $AttributeMapping > SCIMPayload.json
   ```

1. You can open the contents of the file ```SCIMPayload.json``` to verify if the SCIM attributes are set as per mapping defined in the file ```AttributeMapping.psd1```.

1. You can post this file as-is to the Provisioning API endpoint using Graph Explorer or Postman. Reference: 

   - [Quick start with Graph Explorer](quick-start-inbound-provisioning-api-graph-explorer.md) 
   - [Quick start with Postman](quick-start-inbound-provisioning-api-postman.md)

   Or you can refer to the next step and directly upload the generated payload to the API endpoint. 


## Generate and upload SCIM payload with standard schema

Building upon the previous section, we'll demonstrate how to send the generated SCIM payload to your Azure AD Inbound Provisioning API endpoint with the script. 

1. Log in to your Entra portal as *Application Administrator*.
1. Copy the ServicePrincipalId associated with your provisioning app from **Provisioning App** > **Properties** > **Object ID**.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/object-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Object ID.":::

1. Run the following command. This promts you for authentication if an authenticated session doesn't already exist for this tenant. As long as the authenticated user has *Application Administrator* or *Global Administrator* role, the command should succeed, and it posts the generated SCIM payload to the API endpoint. 

   ```powershell
   .\CSV2SCIM.ps1 -Path '..\Samples\csv-with-2-records.csv' -AttributeMapping $AttributeMapping -ServicePrincipalId <servicePrincipalId> -TenantId "contoso.onmicrosoft.com"
   ```

## Get provisioning logs of the latest Sync Cycles

After sending the SCIM Request, we can query the logs of the latest sync cycles processed by Azure AD. We can see the sync statistics from the logs, or we can return the sync details from the logs and save them to a variable for further analysis.

1. To just show the log details and sync statistics on the console, we need to execute the script as the following example:

   ```powershell
   .\CSV2SCIM.ps1 -ServicePrincipalId <servicePrincipalId> -tenantid "contoso.onmicrosoft.com" -GetPreviousCycleLogs -NumberOfCycles 1
   ```

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/stats.png" alt-text="Screenshot of sync statistics.":::

   >[!NOTE]
   >NumberOfCycles is 1 by default. Specify a number to retrieve more sync cycles.

1. To just show the sync statistics on the console and save the logs details to a variable, we need to execute the script as the following example:

   ```powershell
   $logs=.\CSV2SCIM.ps1 -ServicePrincipalId 995aed29-05e3-4f1a-883e-f17b023d5c81 -tenantid ded4600b-620e-486e-b6f1-8b4fc7166a5f -GetPreviousCycleLogs
   ```

   - To see the details of a specific record we can loop into the collection or select a specific index of it, for example:

     :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/index.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a selected index.":::

   - We can also use the `where-object` statement to search for a specific record using the sourceID or DisplayName:

     :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/index.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a where-object command.":::

   - In the **ProvisioningLogs** property, we can find all the details of the operation done for that specific record:

     :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/logs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of provisioning logs.":::

   - We can see the specific user affected properties on the ModifiedProperties property:

     :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot of properties.":::

## Appendix

### CSV2SCIM PowerShell usage details

Many enterprises rely on CSV extracts shared by their HR teams as the source for identities. The CSV2SCIM PowerShell script is a sample asset provided by Microsoft to enable the conversion of CSV files into a SCIM bulk request payload that can be directly consumed by the Inbound Provisioning API endpoint. 

Here is a list of command-line parameters accepted by this script: 

```powershell
PS > CSV2SCIM.ps1 -Path <path-to-csv-file> 
[-ScimSchemaNamespace <customSCIMSchemaNamespace>] 
[-AttributeMapping $AttributeMapping] 
[-ServicePrincipalId <spn-guid>] 
[-ValidateAttributeMapping]
[-UpdateSchema]
[-ClientId <client-id>]
[-ClientCertificate <certificate-object>]
```

.[!Important]
>The `AttributeMapping` and `ValidateAttributeMapping` command-line parameters refer to the mapping of CSV column attributes to the standard SCIM schema elements. 
It doesn't refer to the attribute mappings that you perform in the Entra portal provisioning app between source SCIM schema elements and target Azure AD/on-premises AD attributes. 

| Parameter |	Description | Processing remarks |
|----------|----------------|--------------------|
| Path | The full or relative path to the CSV file. For example, `.\Samples\csv-with-1000-records.csv`	| Mandatory: Yes |
|ScimSchemaNamespace | The custom SCIM Schema namespace to use to send all columns in the CSV file as custom SCIM attributes belonging to specific namespace. For example, `urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:csv:1.0:User` | Mandatory: Only when you want to:</br>- Update the provisioning app schema or </br>When you want to include custom SCIM attributes in the payload. |
| AttributeMapping | Points to a PowerShell Data (.psd1 extension) file that maps columns in the CSV file to SCIM Core User and Enterprise User attributes. </br>See example: [AttributeMapping.psd file for CSV2SCIM script]().</br>
For example:</br>
```powershell
$AttributeMapping = Import-PowerShellDataFile '.\Samples\AttributeMapping.psd1'`
-AttributeMapping $AttributeMapping
``` 
| Mandatory: Yes </br> The only scenario when you don't need to specify this is when using the `UpdateSchema` switch.  |
| ValidateAttributeMapping |Use this Switch flag to validate that the AttributeMapping file contains attributes that comply with the SCIM Core and Enterprise user schema. | Mandatory: No</br>  Recommend using it to ensure compliance. |
| ServicePrincipalId |The GUID value of your provisioning app's service principal ID, which you can retrieve from the **Provisioning App** > **Properties** > **Object ID**| Mandatory: Only when you want to: </br>- Update the provisioning app schema or</br>When you want to send the generated SCIM bulk request to the API endpoint. |
| UpdateSchema |Use this switch to instruct the script to read the CSV columns and add them as custom SCIM attributes in your provisioning app schema.| | 	
| ClientId |The Client ID of an Azure AD registered app to use for OAuth authentication flow. This app must have valid certificate credentials. | Mandatory: Only when performing certificate-based authentication. |
| ClientCertificate |The Client Authentication Certificate to use during OAuth flow. | Mandatory: Only when performing certificate-based authentication.|
| GetPreviousCycleLogs |To get the provisioning logs of the latest sync cycles. | |	
| NumberOfCycles | To specify how many sync cycles should be retrieved. This value is 1 by default.| |	

### AttributeMapping.psd file for CSV2SCIM script

This file is used to map columns in the CSV file to standard SCIM Core User and Enterprise User attribute schema elements. The file also generates an appropriate representation of the CSV file contents as a SCIM bulk request payload. 

In the next example, we mapped the following columns in the CSV file to their counterpart SCIM Core User and Enterprise User attributes.

:::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/stats.png" alt-text="Screenshot of CSV columns for mapped attributes.":::

```powershell
	@{
    externalId   = 'WorkerID'
    name         = @{
        familyName = 'LastName'
        givenName  = 'FirstName'
    }
    active       = { $_.'WorkerStatus' -eq 'Active' }
    userName     = 'UserID'
    displayName  = 'FullName'
    nickName     = 'UserID'
    userType     = 'WorkerType'
    title        = 'JobTitle'
    addresses    = @(
        @{
            type          = { 'work' }
            streetAddress = 'StreetAddress'
            locality      = 'City'
            postalCode    = 'ZipCode'
            country       = 'CountryCode'
        }
    )
    phoneNumbers = @(
        @{
            type  = { 'work' }
            value = 'OfficePhone'
        }
    )
    "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User" = @{
        employeeNumber = 'WorkerID'
        costCenter     = 'CostCenter'
        organization   = 'Company'
        division       = 'Division'
        department     = 'Department'
        manager        = @{
            value = 'ManagerID'
        }
    }
}
```

### Extending provisioning job schema with CSV2SCIM script

Often the data file sent by HR teams contains more attributes that don't have a direct representation in the standard SCIM schema. To represent such attributes, we recommend creating a SCIM extension schema and adding attributes under this namespace. 

The CSV2SCIM script provides an execution mode called UpdateSchema which reads all columns in the CSV file, adds them under an extension schema namespace, and updates the provisioning app schema. 

>[!NOTE] 
>If the attribute extensions are already present in the provisioning app schema, then this mode only emits a warning that the attribute extension already exists. So, there is no issue running the CSV2SCIM script in the **UpdateSchema** mode if new fields are added to the CSV file and you want to add them as an extension. 

To illustrate the procedure, we'll use the CSV file ```Samples/csv-with-2-records.csv``` present in the **azure-activedirectory-inbound-provisioning** folder. 

1. Open the CSV file ```Samples/csv-with-2-records.csv``` in a Notepad, Excel, or TextPad to check the columns present in the file. 

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/check-columns.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to check CSV columns.":::

1. Run the following command: 

   ```powershell
   .\CSV2SCIM.ps1 -Path '..\Samples\csv-with-2-records.csv' -UpdateSchema -ServicePrincipalId 9fdf10c1-9bd5-4968-8cfa-7c2b63567464 -TenantId "contoso.onmicrosoft.com" -ScimSchemaNamespace "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:contoso:1.0:User"
   ```

1. You can verify the update to your provisioning app schema by opening the **Attribute Mapping** page and accessing the **Edit attribute list for API** option under **Advanced options**. 

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell/advanced-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Attribute Mapping in Advanced options.":::

1. The **Attribute List** shows attributes under the new namespace.
