# Configuring Microsoft Entra ID to provision users into SAP ECC with NetWeaver AS ABAP 7.0 or later
The following documentation provides configuration and tutorial information demonstrating how to provision users from Microsoft Entra ID into SAP ERP Central Component (SAP ECC, formerly SAP R/3) with NetWeaver 7.0 or later. If you are using other versions of SAP R/3, you can still use the guides provided in the [download center package Connectors for Microsoft Identity Manager 2016](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=51495) as a reference to build your own template and configure provisioning. If you are using SAP S/4HANA or other SAP SaaS applications, follow the [configure SAP Cloud Identity Services for automatic user provisioning tutorial](~/identity/saas-apps/sap-cloud-platform-identity-authentication-provisioning-tutorial.md) instead. For more information on the SAP integrations, see [manage access to your SAP applications](~/id-governance/sap.md).
