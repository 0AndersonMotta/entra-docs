# Using SCIM and Microsoft Graph together to provision users and enrich your application with the data it needs

Developers can use this reference to understand the various tools that Microsoft provides to automate creating, updating, and deleting users in your application. 

**Common scenarios**

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Automatically create users in my application
> * Automatically remove users from my application when they shouldn't have access anymore
> * Integrate my application with multiple identity providers for provisioning
> * Enrich my application with data from Microsoft services such as Sharepoint, Outlook, and Office.
> * Automatically create, update, and delete users and groups in Azure AD and Active Directory

![SCIM Graph decision tree](./media/user-provisioning/scim-graph.png)

## Scenario 1: Automatically create users in my application
Today, IT manually create user accounts in my application each time someone needs access or pereodically upload CSV files. The process is time consuming for customers and slows down adoption of my application. All I need is basic [user](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-1.0) information such as name, email, and userPrincipalName to create a user. Furthermore, my customers use various IdPs and I don't have the resources to maintain custom integrations with each IdP. 

**Recommendation**: Support a SCIM compliant [/Users](https://aka.ms/scimreferencecode) endpoint. Your customers will be able to easily use this endpoint to integrate with the Azure AD provisioning service and automatically create user accounts when they need access. Check out the example request below for how a user would be created.

```json
POST /Users
{
	"schemas": [
	    "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User",
	    "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User"],
	"externalId": "0a21f0f2-8d2a-4f8e-bf98-7363c4aed4ef",
	"userName": "BillG",
	"active": true,
	"meta": {
		"resourceType": "User"
	},
	"name": {
		"formatted": "Bill Gates",
		"familyName": "Gates",
		"givenName": "Bill"
	},
	"roles": []
}
```
    
## Scenario 2: Automatically remove users from my application when they shouldn't have access anymore
The customers using my application are security focused and have governance requirements to remove accounts when people don't need them anymore. How can I automate deprovisioning from my application?

**Recommendation:** Support a SCIM compliant /Users endpoint. The Azure AD provisioning service will send requests to disable and delete when the user should not have access anymore. We recommend supporting both disabling and deleting users. 

Disable user
```json
PATCH /Users/5171a35d82074e068ce2 HTTP/1.1
{
    "Operations": [
        {
            "op": "Replace",
            "path": "active",
            "value": false
        }
    ],
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"
    ]
}
```
Delete user
```json
DELETE /Users/5171a35d82074e068ce2 HTTP/1.1
```

## Scenario 3: Automate provisioning groups and managing group memberships in my application. 
My application relies on groups for access to various resources, and customers want to reuse the groups that they have in Azure AD. How can I import groups from Azure AD and keep them updated as the memberships change?  

**Recommendation:** Support a SCIM compliant /Groups endpoint. The Azure AD provisioning service will take care of creating groups and managing memmbership updates in your application. 

## Scenario 4: Enrich my application with data from Microsoft services such as Sharepoint, Outlook, and Office.
My application relies on Sharepoint to provide access to users to resources as well as information from Outlook. How can I enrich my application with data from those resources?

**Recommendation:** The Microsoft Graph is your entry point to access Microsoft resources. Each workload exposes APIs so that you can access the Microsoft data that you need. The Microsoft graph can be used along with SCIM provisioning for the scenarios above. You can use SCIM to provision basic user attributes into your application while calling into graph to get any other data that you need. 

## Scenario 5: Automatically create, update, and delete users and groups in Azure AD and Active Directory
My application creates information about a user that customers need in Azure AD. This could be an HR application than manages hiring, a communications app that creates phone numbers for users, or some other app that generates data that would be valuable in Azure AD. How do I populate the user record in Azure AD with that data? 

**Recommendation** The Microsoft graph exposes / Users and /Groups endpoints that you can integrate with today to provision users into Azure AD. Please note that those users will not be synchronized down to on-prem Active Directory.  

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft has a provisioning service that pulls in data from HR applications such as Workday and SuccessFactors. These integrations are built and managed by Microsoft. For onboarding a new HR application to our service, you can request it [here](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/374982-azure-active-directory-application-requests) on UserVoice.
