# Azure AD registered devices

The goal of Azure AD registered devices is to provide you with support for the **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** scenario. In this scenario, a user can access your organization’s Azure Active Directory controlled resources using a personal device.

The access is based on a work or school account that has been entered on the device.  
For example, Windows 10 enables users to add a work or school account to a personal computer, tablet, or phone.  
When a user has added a work or school account, the device is registered with Azure AD and optionally enrolled in the mobile device management (MDM) system that your organization has configured.
Your organization’s users can add a work or school account to a personal device conveniently:

- When accessing a work application for the first time
- Manually via the **Settings** menu in the case of Windows 10

You can configure an Azure AD registered device state for **Windows 10 personal, iOS, Android and macOS** devices.
