# What is a device identity?

In a mobile-first, cloud-first world, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) enables single sign-on to devices, apps, and services from anywhere. With the proliferation of devices - including Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), IT professionals are faced with two opposing goals:

- Empower the end users to be productive wherever and whenever
- Protect the organization's assets

Through these devices, your users get access to your organization's assets. To protect these assets, IT professionals need to manage the device identities. This enables you to make sure that your users are accessing resources from devices that meet your organization's standards for security and compliance.

Device identity management is the foundation for [device-based conditional access](../conditional-access/require-managed-devices.md). With device-based conditional access policies, you can ensure that access to resources in your environment is only possible with managed devices.

## Getting devices in Azure AD

To get a device in Azure AD, you have multiple options:

- Azure AD registered
   - Devices that are Azure AD registered are typically personally owned or mobile devices, and are signed into with a personal Microsoft account or another local account.
      - Windows 10
      - iOS
      - Android
      - MacOS
- Azure AD joined
   - Devices that are Azure AD joined are owned by an organization, and are signed in to with an Azure AD account belonging to that organization.
      - Windows 10 
- Hybrid Azure AD joined
   - Devices that are hybrid Azure AD joined are owned by an organization, and are signed in to with an Azure AD account belonging to that organization.
      - Windows 7, 8.1, or 10
      - Windows Server 2008 or newer

## Device management

Devices in Azure AD can be managed using Mobile Device Management (MDM) tools like Microsoft Intune, System Center Configuration Manager, Group Policy (hybrid Azure AD join), or other Mobile Application Management (MAM) tools. 

## Resource access

Registering and joining give your users Seamless Sign-on (SSO) to cloud resources and administrators the ability to apply Conditional Access policies to those resources. 

Devices that are Azure AD joined or hybrid Azure AD joined benefit from SSO to your organization's on-premises resources as well as cloud resources. More information can be found in the article, [How SSO to on-premises resources works on Azure AD joined devices](azuread-join-sso.md).

## Device security

- **Azure AD registered devices** utilize an account managed by the end-user, this is either a Microsoft account or another locally managed credential secured with one or more of the following.
   - Password
   - PIN
   - Pattern
   - Windows Hello
- **Azure AD joined or hybrid Azure AD joined devices** utilize an organizational account in Azure AD secured with the secured with one or more of the following.
   - Password
   - Windows Hello for Business

## Provisioning

Getting devices in to Azure AD can be done in a self-service manner or a controlled provisioning process by administrators.

## Summary

With device identity management in Azure AD, you can:

- Simplify the process of bringing and managing devices in Azure AD
- Provide your users with an easy to use access to your organizationâ€™s cloud-based resources

## License requirements

[!INCLUDE [Active Directory P1 license](../../../includes/active-directory-p1-license.md)]
