```
## Scenario overview

There several scenarios that require Azure resources access other Azure services. Today, Managed Identities for Azure resources facilitate such access by eliminating the need for credential management. Unfortunately, managed identities are only an option if all resources belong to the same Azure AD Tenant. Several service providers building SaaS offerings on Azure want to provide their customers with the option of using Customer-Managed Keys to encrypt data. Customer data would be encrypted using an encryption key managed by the service provider’s customer using Azure Key Vault managed using the customer’s Azure AD Tenant and subscription. To enable that scenario the Azure resources owned and hosted in the service provider's tenant require access to the key from the customer’s tenant to perform encryption/decryption operations. In this private preview, we are introducing a new Azure AD feature to address this multi tenant scenario called workload identity federation. We look forward to your feedback and Thank you for your participation in this private preview!


## Solution

As part of this private preview, the service provider/ISV can create a multi-tenant application in Azure AD. Azure AD allows the creation of a “federated identity credential" for the application. With this new type of credential, you can configure an existing Managed Identity's service principal in Azure AD to impersonate the identity of the Azure AD Application in a tenant where the application is installed. Using this configuration a managed identity, both system-assigned and user-assigned managed identities, can impersonate, get tokens, as a multi-tenant application in any tenant in which the application is installed. 

>[!NOTE]
>A user-assigned managed identity can be assigned one or more Azure resources. With the assignment, Azure resources can now request tokens as the multi-tenant Azure AD application.

In the customer's tenant, (the service provider's customer) users with the appropriate permissions can install the enterprise application, represented as a service principal. You can achieve this either using the application consent experience or simply calling Microsoft Graph API to create the service principal. Once provisioned, the service principal can be granted access to the necessary Azure resources, like an Azure Key Vault, where the CMK is stored. From the customer’s perspective, they are installing an application in Azure AD (thus creating an identity to represent the application) that is published by the service provider they trust and allowing that application access to the required resources. They do not have other visibility into how the application is implemented. We divide the end-to-end solution into three phases as described further. Phase 1 can be a one-time setup. Phases 2 and 3 would be repeated for each other customer. 

### Phase 1 - Service Provider configures Identities

| No | Step | Least privileged Azure Roles | Least privileged Azure AD Roles | 
| -- | ----------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------| 
| 1. | Create a multi-tenant Azure AD application registration or start with an existing application registration. Note the ApplicationId (also known as ClientId) of the application registration. <br>[Azure portal](../develop/quickstart-register-app) / [Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/application-post-applications?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http) / [Azure AD PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azuread/new-azureadapplication?view=azureadps-2.0) / [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ad/app?view=azure-cli-latest#az_ad_app_create) | None | User with permissions to create Applications 
| 2. | Create a user-assigned managed identity (to be used as a Federated Identity Credential). <br> [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities?pivots=identity-mi-methods-azp) / [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities?pivots=identity-mi-methods-azcli) / [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities?pivots=identity-mi-methods-powershell)/ [Azure Resource Manager Templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities?pivots=identity-mi-methods-arm) | [Manage identity contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#managed-identity-contributor) | None | 
| 3. | Configure user-assigned managed identity as a *federated identity credential* on the application, so that it can impersonate the identity of the application. <br> [Graph API reference](https://aka.ms/fedcredentialapi) : Microsoft-internal link during Private Preview, shared as attachment with participants. | None | Owner of the application | 
| 4. | Share the ApplicationId with the customer, so that they can install the application. | None | None| 


### Phase 2 - Customer authorizes Azure Key Vault
| No | Step | Least privileged Azure Roles | Least privileged Azure AD Roles | 
| -- | ----------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------|

### Important callouts
 
1. In the customer tenant, an admin can set policies to block non-admin users from consenting to or installing Applications. Such policies can prevent non-admin users (users without a specific Azure AD role) from creating the desired service principal in the customer tenant. If such a policy is configured, then users with permissions to create service principals will have to be involved.
2. Today it is not possible to create new Azure AD Application registrations using ARM templates. It is on the roadmap, but the timelines are unknown and beyond the scope of this private preview. 
3. Azure Key Vault can be configured with [network protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview-vnet-service-endpoints). Accessing a key vault configured to be accessed from specific networks is out of scope of this private preview.

## Requirements

### Service Provider Tenant
1. Service-Provider Azure AD Tenant (for example -BestServiceProvider.com)
2. An Azure subscription associated with Service-Provider Tenant–(for example, AppSubscription1)

## Step-by-step instructions for Private Preview with Azure Storage 

This section provides step-by-step tutorial to create a working setup. At the end of this tutorial, you will have a new Azure storage account that is configured for encryption with a key vault from another tenant.


### Phase 1 - Service Provider configures identities
#### Step 0 - Log in to Azure
Log in to Azure to use Azure CLI 
```azurecli-interactive
az login
```
#### Step 1 - Create a new Multi-tenant AAD Application registration
Pick a name for your Multi-Tenant Azure AD Application. For example: “XTCMKDemoApp”. This name is used by your customers to identify the Application. Note the “AppId” generated for this application. Also note the “ObjectId”generated for this application–referred as appObjectId in this document. 

```azurecli-interactive
username=$(az account show --query user.name --out tsv)
tenantId=$(az account show --query tenantId --out tsv)
echo "Logged in as username = $username from Tenant = $tenantId"
# Create Multi-Tenant App registration
appName="XTCMKDemoApp"
appObjectId=$(az ad app create --display-name $appName --available-to-other-tenants true --query objectId --out tsv)
appId=$(az ad app show --id $appObjectId --query appId --out tsv)
echo "Multi-tenant AAD Application has appId = $appId and ObjectId = $appObjectId"
```

#### Step 2 - Create a resource group and a user-assigned managed identity

```azurecli-interactive
subscriptionId="<replace-with-your-subscriptionId"
rgName="XTCMKDemo"
location="eastus2euap" # This is the Azure canary.
az group create --location $location --resource-group $rgName --subscription $subscriptionId
echo "Created a new resource group with name = $rgName, location = $location in subscriptionid = $subscriptionId"
uamiName="xtcmkFIC"
uamiObjectId=$(az identity create --name $uamiName --resource-group $rgName --location $location --subscription $subscriptionId --query principalId --out tsv)
```
#### Step 3 - Configure user-assigned managed identity as a *federated identity credential* on the application

```azurecli-interactive
az rest --method POST --uri 'https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/applications/<replace-with-appObjectId>/federatedIdentityCredentials' --body '{"name":"test01","issuer":"https://login.microsoftonline.com/<replace-with-tenantId>/v2.0","subject":"<replace-with-uamiObjectId","description":"This is a new test federated identity credential","audiences":["api://AzureADTokenExchange"]}'
```
#### Step 4 - Share the AppId with the customers.
Find the “AppId” of the Azure AD MT application and share it with the customers. In this example, it is "appId"

### Phase 2 - Customer Tenant authorizes Azure Key Vault
#### Step 1 Install the Azure AD Application using AppId in the customer tenant.
Once you receive the “AppId” from the Service Provider Tenant, install the application using the following command(installation of the application is equivalent to creation of service principal).

```azurecli-interactive
#Login to Azure
az login

# Install the application
appId='<replace-the-multi-tenant-ApplicationId' #appId from Phase 1.
appObjectId=$(az ad sp create --id appId --query objectId --out tsv)
appObjectId=$(az ad sp show --id appId --query objectId --out tsv)
```

#### Step 2 Create a key vault and encryption keys

1. Create Azure RBAC role assignments for the current user. This role assignment is required so that the user continues to have access to the key vault via Azure RBAC after its creation. 

```azurecli-interactive
#Role assignments to manageresourcesandkeyvaultsintheresourcegroup.
rgName='CMKKeys'
subscriptionId='<replace-your-subscriptionId'

az group create --location $location --name $rgName
currentUserObjectId=$(az ad signed-in-user show --query objectId --out tsv)
# Create Azure RBAC Role assignment to manage resouces and key vaults in the resource group.
az role assignment create --role "00482a5a-887f-4fb3-b363-3b7fe8e74483" --scope /subscriptions/$subscriptionId/resourceGroups/$rgName --assignee-object-id $currentUserObjectId
az role assignment create --role 8e3af657-a8ff-443c-a75c-2fe8c4bcb635 --scope /subscriptions/$subscriptionId/resourceGroups/$rgName --assignee-object-id $currentUserObjectId
```

2. Create key vault
Now create an Azure Key Vault

```azurecli-interactive
vaultName='<provide-a-name-for-keyvault'
location='pick-a-location' # for example: location='centralus'
az keyvault create --location $location --name $vaultName --resource-group $rgName --subscription $subscriptionId --enable-purge-protection true --enable-rbac-authorization true --query name --out tsv
```
3. Create an encryption key in the Key Vault.

```azurecli-interactive
az keyvault key create --name mastercmkkey --vault-name $vaultName
```

#### Grant Service Provider Application access to the key vault.
Assign the **Key Vault Crypto Service user** role to the service-provider application at the resource group scope.

```azurecli-interactive
az role assignment create --role e147488a-f6f5-4113-8e2d-b22465e65bf6 --scope /subscriptions/$subscriptionId/resourceGroups/$rgName/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/$vaultName --assignee-object-id $appObjectId

```

### Phase 3 - Service Provider Tenant- Configures Customer Managed Keys
Create a file for ARM template –called XTCMK-storage.json.

```json

            "defaultAction": "Allow"
          },
          "supportsHttpsTrafficOnly": true,
          "encryption": {
            "identity": {
              "userAssignedIdentity": "[parameters('userassignedmicmk')]",
              "federatedIdentityClientId": "[parameters('cmkfederatedclientId')]"
            },
            "keyvaultproperties": {
              "keyvaulturi": "[parameters('keyVaultURL')]",
              "keyname": "[parameters('CMKkeyName')]"
            },
            "services": {
              "file": {
                "keyType": "Account",
                "enabled": true
              },
              "blob": {
                "keyType": "Account",
                "enabled": true
              }
            },
            "keySource": "Microsoft.Keyvault"
          },
          "accessTier": "Hot"
        }
      }      
    ]
  }

```

Then run the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az deployment group create --resource-group $rgName --template-file .\XTCMK-Storage.json
```
