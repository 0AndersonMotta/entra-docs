# View the service principal of a managed identity in the Azure portal

Managed identities for Azure resources provides Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory. You can use this identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, without having credentials in your code. 

In this article, you learn how to view the service principal of a managed identity using the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, check out the [overview section](overview.md).
- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- Enable [system assigned identity on a virtual machine](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm#system-assigned-managed-identity) or [application](/azure/app-service/app-service-managed-service-identity#adding-a-system-assigned-identity).
