# View the service principal of a managed identity using Azure CLI

Managed identities for Azure resources provides Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory. You can use this identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication without having credentials in your code. 

In this article, you learn how to view the service principal of a managed identity using Azure CLI.
