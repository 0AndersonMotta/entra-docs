Managed identities for Azure resources eliminate the need to manage credentials in code. They allow you to get an Azure active directory token your applications can use when accessing resources that support Azure Active Directory authentication. Azure manages the identity so you don't have to. There are two types of managed identities â€“ system-assigned and user-assigned. The main difference between the two types is that system assigned managed identities have their lifecycle linked to the resource where they are used. User assigned managed identities may be used on multiple resources. You can learn more about managed identities in the managed identities [overview](../overview.md). In this article, you learn how to create, list, and delete a user-assigned managed identity using CURL to make REST API calls.

## Prerequisites

- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, check out the [overview section](../overview.md). **Be sure to review the [difference between a system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity](../overview.md#managed-identity-types)**.
- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before continuing.
- You can run all the commands in this article either in the cloud or locally:
    - To run in the cloud, use the [Azure Cloud Shell](../../../cloud-shell/overview.md).
    - To run locally, install [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) and the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Obtain a bearer access token

1. If running locally, sign into Azure through the Azure CLI:

    ```
    az login
    ```

1. Obtain an access token using [az account get-access-token](/cli/azure/account#az_account_get_access_token)

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az account get-access-token
    ```

## Create a user-assigned managed identity 

To create a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Contributor](../../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

[!INCLUDE [ua-character-limit](~/includes/managed-identity-ua-character-limits.md)]

```bash
curl 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroup
s/<RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>?api-version=2015-08-31-preview' -X PUT -d '{"loc
ation": "<LOCATION>"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>"
```

```HTTP
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroup
s/<RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>?api-version=2015-08-31-preview HTTP/1.1
```

**Request headers**

|Request header  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|*Content-Type*     | Required. Set to `application/json`.        |
|*Authorization*     | Required. Set to a valid `Bearer` access token.        |

**Request body**

|Name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|location     | Required. Resource location.        |

## List user-assigned managed identities

To list/read a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Operator](../../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-operator) or [Managed Identity Contributor](../../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

```bash
curl 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities?api-version=2015-08-31-preview' -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>"
```

```HTTP
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities?api-version=2015-08-31-preview HTTP/1.1
```

|Request header  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|*Content-Type*     | Required. Set to `application/json`.        |
|*Authorization*     | Required. Set to a valid `Bearer` access token.        |

## Delete a user-assigned managed identity

To delete a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Contributor](../../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

> [!NOTE]
> Deleting a user-assigned managed identity will not remove the reference from any resource it was assigned to. To remove a user-assigned managed identity from a VM using CURL see [Remove a user-assigned identity from an Azure VM](../qs-configure-rest-vm.md#remove-a-user-assigned-managed-identity-from-an-azure-vm).

```bash
curl 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroup
s/<RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>?api-version=2015-08-31-preview' -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>"
```

```HTTP
DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/80c696ff-5efa-4909-a64d-f1b616f423ca/resourceGroups/TestRG/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>?api-version=2015-08-31-preview HTTP/1.1
```
|Request header  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|*Content-Type*     | Required. Set to `application/json`.        |
|*Authorization*     | Required. Set to a valid `Bearer` access token.        |
