Password writeback provides a seamless and secure mechanism to send passwords back to an existing on-premises directory from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Password writeback is a component of Azure AD Connect.

## Prerequisites

You need a working Azure AD tenant with at least a trial license enabled.
An account with Global Administrator privileges.
An existing server running a current version of [Azure AD Connect](../connect/active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-express.md)

## Enable password writeback in Azure AD Connect

1. To configure and enable password writeback, sign in to your Azure AD Connect server and start the **Azure AD Connect** configuration wizard.
2. On the **Welcome** page, select **Configure**.
3. On the **Additional tasks** page, select **Customize synchronization options**, and then select **Next**.
4. On the **Connect to Azure AD** page, enter a global administrator credential, and then select **Next**.
5. On the **Connect directories** and **Domain/OU** filtering pages, select **Next**.
6. On the **Optional features** page, select the box next to **Password writeback** and select **Next**.
7. On the **Ready to configure** page, select **Configure** and wait for the process to finish.
8. When you see the configuration finish, select **Exit**.

## Log in to Azure

Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using a Global Administrator account.

## Enable SSPR on-premises integration

In the Azure portal browse to **Azure Active Directory**, click on **Password Reset**, then choose **On-premises integration**.

Under **Write back passwords to your on-premises directory**, choose **Yes**.
Under **Allow users to unlock accounts without resetting their password**, choose **Yes**.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you have enabled password writeback for SSPR. Leave the Azure portal window open and continue to the next tutorial to configure additional settings related to SSPR before you roll out the solution in a pilot.
