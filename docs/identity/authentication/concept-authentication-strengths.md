# Azure AD authentication strengths overview 

Authentication strengths are a set of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication method combinations that can be used to authenticate users for scenarios that require multifactor authentication (MFA). Admins can use Conditional Access (CA) to choose from a set of predefined combinations, or create a custom set of combinations. Authentication strengths let admins distinguish which authentication methods can be used based on factors such as:

- The app the user is accessing
- The user’s risk 
- Other contexts offered in CA policies

When an authentication strength applies to all applications and the user is not registered for any of its methods, the user will get stuck in a loop if they access any application.
You may encounter various typographical mistakes, or spelling inconsistencies. Please feel free to point these outand we’ll fixthem as we have time.The Sign-in logs show incomplete information for Authentication StrengthsA)[Grant Control] section in [Conditional Access Policy Details] will always show “Satisfied”, even if the Authentication Strength requirement wasn’t satisfiedNOTE: Authentication Details do show the expected status (Succeeded = false)B)[Authentication requirement] field on the Basic info tab always shows “Single-factor authentication” when Authentication Strength requirements were satisfiedC)Authentication Strengths are not evaluated if the conditional access policy is in “Report-only” mode. You must enable the policy to see information in the sign-in logsThe audit logs are missing details for creation of and updates to authentication strengthsCertain scenarios are not restricted by the Authentication Strengths UX, and may result in a generic error message. To see the error, you will need to open up the edge network inspector(Control + Shift + J), reproduce the error, and then click on the $batch request and expand the response:Known errors that can result in this error message:A)Authentication Strength names cannot be longer than 30 charactersB)Authentication Strengths cannot be deleted while they are in useLimitations of Conditional Access policiesConditional access policies are only evaluated after the initial authentication. This means that authentication strengths will not restrict the authentication method used for the user’s first factor. For example, if you are using the phishing-resistant built-in strength, this will not prevent a user from typing in their password, but they will be required to use a FIDO2 key before they can continue.Private Preview prerequisites•Test this private preview only in your test tenant (not in production tenant)
•The test tenant needsto have Azure AD Premium P1 license to use Conditional Access(You can enable Trial license from Azure Portalif you haven’t before)Types of Authentication Strengths1.Built-in StrengthsMicrosoft has already defined some combinations of authentication methods. These combinations are always available and cannot be modified. This chart shows which methods/combinations are included in each built-in Authentication Strength. End users will need to satisfy one of these methods when the strength enforced by a CA policy.Authentication MethodCombinationMulti-factor authenticationstrengthPasswordless authentication strengthPhishingresistantauthentication strengthWindows Hello for Business✔✔✔FIDO2 security key✔✔✔x509 Certificate (multi-factor)✔✔✔Passwordless sign-in with the Microsoft Authenticator App✔✔Temporary Access Pass (single or multi-use)✔Password + Something you have note✔Federated multi-factor authentication✔Federated single-factor authentication+ Something you have note✔x509 Certificate (single-factor)SMS sign-inPasswordFederated single-factor authenticationEmail One-time pass (Guest)Note: “Something you have” refers to one of the following methods:SMS, Voice, Push notification, Softwareor Hardware-based OATH tokenThe following API callcan be used to listdefinitionsof all the built-in Authentication Strength by callingthis API endpoint:

Custom strengths can contain any of the combinations in the above table.
