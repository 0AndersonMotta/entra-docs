# MFA Wizard (Public preview) This is a place holder name

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) features help you manage and secure your organization. These setup guides will help you integrate those features in a simple way. In the following sections, we’ll briefly describe the setup guides and share links to the guides.

## Who is this setup guide for?

This setup guide is designed for small to medium-sized organizations that typically might not have a dedicated identity team. You don’t need to be an identity expert to use it.

## What to expect and what you’ll need

The setup guides help you configure the core functionality of Azure AD. If you need to set up a more advanced configuration, the setup guide will point you to the appropriate location in the Azure AD portal.

### Required permissions

You must be a member of the following administrative roles:

- Global administrator: allows you to use integrated tools in the setup guides to make changes in your Microsoft 365 organization.

- Global reader: allows you to view the setup guides but not make changes in your tenant.

## Configure multi-factor authentication (MFA)

For customers with Azure P1 or Azure P2, we provide customizable Conditional Access templates that include the most common and least intrusive security standards. When Azure licensing isn’t available, we provide a one-click solution to enable security defaults, a baseline protection policy for all users, or we provide steps to enable legacy (per-user) MFA.

## Licensing

Conditional Access requires an Azure Active Directory P1 or P2 license. Security defaults and per-user MFA are included with all Microsoft 365 subscriptions.
