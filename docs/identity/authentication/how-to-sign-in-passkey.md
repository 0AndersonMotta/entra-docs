# Sign in with a passkey (FIDO2) (preview)

Passkeys are a replacement for your password. With passkeys, you can sign into your Microsoft account using your face, fingerprint, or PIN. Signing in with a passkey is simple, fast, and helps protect you against phishing attacks. For information about FIDO2 support, see [Support for FIDO2 authentication with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/authentication/concept-fido2-compatibility.md).

## Prerequisite

In order for sign in with a passkey to work successfully, you'll first need to create a passkey. For more information, see [Register a passkey (preview)](~/identity/authentication/how-to-register-passkey.md).
