    questions:
      - question: |
          Can I use Authenticator as a passkey provider on Android 13 or earlier or iOS 16 or earlier?
        answer: |
          Authenticator uses operating system APIs as a passkey provider. These APIs are available only on Android 14+ and iOS 17+ devices, which means passkeys in Authenticator are only available on devices that run Android 14 and later or iOS 17 and later.
      - question: |
          Do I need to have bluetooth enabled to perform cross-device authentication?
        answer: |
          To complete cross-device authentication using passkeys in Authenticator, you must have bluetooth enabled on both the laptop and the mobile device, and both devices must also be connected to the internet. 
      - question: |
          Can I have multiple passkeys in Authenticator?
        answer: |        
          You can only have one passkey for each account in Authenticator. At this time, Authenticator only supports passkeys for Entra ID.
      - question: |
          Can I use Authenticator app camera to scan the WebAuthn qr code for registration/authentication?
        answer: |
          You can use the Authenticator camera on Android to register and authenticate with passkeys. This is particularly useful if your organization hasn't pushed the system camera app to Android Work Profile. This capability isn't supported in the Authenticator app on iOS at this time.
