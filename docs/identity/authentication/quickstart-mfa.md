# Quickstart: Azure Multi-Factor Authentication

In this quickstart, you configure Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (Azure MFA) and create a conditional access policy to require multi-factor authentication when accessing the Azure portal if a member of the pilot group.

## Prerequisites

* A working Azure AD tenant with at least a trial license enabled.
* An account with Global Administrator privileges.
* A standard non-administrator user with a password you know for testing, if you need to create a user see the article [Quickstart: Add new users to Azure Active Directory](../add-users-azure-active-directory.md)
* A pilot group to test with that the non-administrator user is a member of, if you need to create a group see the article [Create a group and add members in Azure Active Directory](../active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal.md)

## Log in to Azure

Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using a Global Administrator account.
