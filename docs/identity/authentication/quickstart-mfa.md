# Customer intent: As an Azure AD Administrator, I want to enhance user authentication with MFA to make sure the user is who they say they are.

# Quickstart: Enable Azure Multi-Factor Authentication

In this quickstart, you walk you through configuring a conditional access policy enabling Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (Azure MFA) when logging in to the Azure portal. The policy is deployed to and tested on a specific group of pilot users. Deployment of Azure MFA using conditional access provides significant flexibility for organizations and administrators compared to the traditional enforced method.

## Prerequisites

* A working Azure AD tenant with at least a trial license enabled.
* An account with Global Administrator privileges.
* A non-administrator test user with a password you know for testing, if you need to create a user see the article [Quickstart: Add new users to Azure Active Directory](../add-users-azure-active-directory.md).
* A pilot group to test with that the non-administrator user is a member of, if you need to create a group see the article [Create a group and add members in Azure Active Directory](../active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal.md).

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using a Global Administrator account.

## Choose verification options

Before enabling Azure Multi-Factor Authentication, your organization must determine what verification options they allow. For the purpose of this quickstart, you enable call to phone and text message to phone as they are generic options that most are able to use.

1. Browse to **Azure Active Directory**, **Users**, **Multi-Factor Authentication**

2. In the new tab that opens browse to **service settings**
3. Under **verification options**, check the following boxes for methods available to users
   * Call to phone
   * Text message to phone

## Test Azure Multi-Factor Authentication

To prove that your conditional access policy works, you test logging in to a resource that should not require MFA and then to the Azure portal that requires MFA.

1. Open a new browser window in InPrivate or incognito mode and browse to [https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com](https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com).
   * Log in with the test user created as part of the prerequisites section of this article and note that it should not ask you to complete MFA.
   * Close the browser window
2. Open a new browser window in InPrivate or incognito mode and browse to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
   * Log in with the test user created as part of the prerequisites section of this article and note that you should now be required to register for and use Azure Multi-Factor Authentication.
   * Close the browser window

## Clean up resources

If you have completed your pilot, you can choose to keep the resources you created or clean up the resources used in this quickstart by completing the following tasks:

* Delete test user
* Delete pilot group
* Delete the **MFA Pilot** conditional access policy
