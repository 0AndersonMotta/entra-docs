# How can Azure Active Directory help my organization protect user authentication?

Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) includes features like Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (Azure MFA) and Azure AD self-service password reset (SSPR) to help administrators protect user authentication.

## Secure and easy to use?

Using things users already have like their cell phone, desk phone, or an app on their phone users can reset their password when they forget it or access applications that require a second factor of authentication.

Administrators retain centralized control of configuration, policy, monitoring, and reporting using Azure AD and the Azure portal.

## Self-service password reset

Users regularly forget their passwords or lock themselves out requiring a call to an organization's help desk.

SSPR provides users the ability to reset their passwords on their own when and where they need to. At the same time, administrators can control complexity, age, and means of reset. Users no longer need to call a help desk just to reset their password.

SSPR includes:

* **Self-service password change:** I know my password but want to change it to something new.
* **Self-service password reset:** I can't sign in and want to reset my password using one or more administrator approved authentication methods.
* **Self-service account unlock:** I can't sign in because my account is locked out and I want to unlock using one or more administrator approved authentication methods.

### Azure AD SSPR availability

SSPR is available in three tiers depending on your subscription:

* **Azure AD Free:** Cloud-only administrators can reset their own passwords.
* **Azure AD Basic** or any **paid Office 365 subscription:** Cloud-only users and administrators can reset their own passwords.
* **Azure AD Premium:** Any user or administrator, including cloud-only, federated, pass-through authentication, or password hash synchronized users, can reset their own passwords. **On-premises users require password writeback to be enabled.**

## Multi-Factor Authentication

Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is Microsoft's two-step verification solution. Azure MFA helps safeguard access to data and applications while meeting user demand for a simple sign-in process.

### Azure Multi-Factor Authentication availability

Azure MFA is available to users in the following versions:

* Multi-Factor Authentication for Office 365: This version works **exclusively with Office 365 applications** and is managed from the Office 365 portal. Administrators can secure Office 365 resources with two-step verification. This version is part of an Office 365 subscription.
* Multi-Factor Authentication for Azure AD Administrators: Users assigned the Global Administrator role in Azure AD tenants can enable two-step verification for their Azure AD Global Admin accounts at no additional cost.
* Azure Multi-Factor Authentication: Often referred to as the "full" version, Azure Multi-Factor Authentication offers the richest set of capabilities. It provides additional configuration options via the Azure portal, advanced reporting, and support for a range of on-premises and cloud applications. Azure Multi-Factor Authentication is included in Azure Active Directory Premium plans and can be deployed either in the cloud or on-premises.
