# Enable passkeys in Authenticator (preview)

For enterprises that use passwords today, passkeys (FIDO2) provide a seamless way for workers to authenticate without entering a username or password. Passkeys provide improved productivity for workers, and have better security.

This topic lists requirements and steps to enable passkey. At the end of this article, you'll be able to sign in to your Microsoft Entra account using a device-bound passkey, such as a FIDO2 security key.

Users can also sign in with a passkey by using Microsoft Authenticator. For more information, see [How to enable Authenticator passkey](how-to-enable-authenticator-passkey.md).

## Requirements

- [Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA)](howto-mfa-getstarted.md)
- Compatible [FIDO2 security keys](concept-authentication-passwordless.md#fido2-security-keys)

Passkeys are supported across major scenarios on Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. For more information on supported scenarios, see [Browser support of FIDO2 passwordless authentication](fido2-compatibility.md).

>[!NOTE]
>Entra ID supports only device-bound passkeys. Support for synced passkeys is coming soon.

## Prepare devices

For devices that are joined to Microsoft Entra ID, the best experience is on Windows 10 version 1903 or higher.

Hybrid-joined devices must run Windows 10 version 2004 or higher.

## Enable passkey (FIDO2) authentication method

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Authentication Policy Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#authentication-policy-administrator).
1. Browse to **Protection** > **Authentication methods** > **Authentication method policy**.
1. Under the method **Passkey (FIDO2)**, click **All users**, or click **Add groups** to select specific groups. *Only security groups are supported*.
1. **Save** the configuration.

   >[!NOTE]
   >If you see an error when you try to save, the cause might be due to the number of users or groups being added. As a workaround, replace the users and groups you are trying to add with a single group, in the same operation, and then click **Save** again.


### Passkey optional settings 

There are some optional settings on the **Configure** tab to help manage how passkeys can be used for sign-in.  

:::image type="content" border="true" source="media/howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key/optional-settings-with-aaguid.png" alt-text="Screenshot of FIDO2 security key options.":::

- **Allow self-service set up** should remain set to **Yes**. If set to no, your users won't be able to register a passkey through MySecurityInfo, even if enabled by Authentication Methods policy.  
- **Enforce attestation** should be set to **Yes** if your organization wants to be assured that a FIDO2 security key model or passkey provider is genuine and comes from the legitimate vendor.
    - For FIDO2 security keys, we require security key metadata to be published and verified with the FIDO Alliance Metadata Service, and also pass Microsoft's additional set of validation testing. For more information, see [What is a Microsoft-compatible security key?](concept-authentication-passwordless.md#fido2-security-key-providers)
    - For passkeys in Microsoft Authenticator, we do not currently support attestation.

  >[!WARNING]
  >Attestation enforcement governs whether a passkey is allowed during registration only. Users who are able to register a passkey without attestation will not be blocked during sign-in if **Enforce attestation** is set to **Yes** at a later time.

**Key Restriction Policy**

- **Enforce key restrictions** should be set to **Yes** only if your organization wants to only allow or disallow certain security key models or passkey providers, which are identified by their Authenticator Attestation GUID (AAGUID). You can work with your security key vendor or passkey provider to determine the AAGUID of a device. If the passkey is already registered, you can find the AAGUID by viewing the authentication method details of the passkey for the user. 

  >[!WARNING]
  >Key restrictions set the usability of specific models or providers for both registration and authentication. If you change key restrictions and remove an AAGUID that you previously allowed, users who previously registered an allowed method can no longer use it for sign-in. 

## Passkey Authenticator Attestation GUID (AAGUID)

The FIDO2 specification requires each security key vendor to provide an Authenticator Attestation GUID (AAGUID) during registration. An AAGUID is a 128-bit identifier indicating the key type, such as the make and model. Passkey providers on desktop and mobile devices are also expected to provide an AAGUID during registration.

>[!NOTE]
>The vendor must ensure that the AAGUID is identical across all substantially identical security keys or passkey providers made by that vendor, and different (with high probability) from the AAGUIDs of all other types of security keys or passkey providers. To ensure this, the AAGUID for a given security key model or passkey provider should be randomly generated. For more information, see [Web Authentication: An API for accessing Public Key Credentials - Level 2 (w3.org)](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/).

There are two ways to get your AAGUID. You can either ask your security key or passkey provider vendor, or view the authentication method details of the key per user.

### Enable passkeys using Microsoft Graph API

In addition to using the Microsoft Entra admin center, you can also enable passkeys by using the Microsoft Graph API. To enable passkeys, you'll need to update the Authentication Methods Policy as a **Global Administrator** or **Authentication Policy Administrator**. 

To configure the policy using Graph Explorer:

1. Sign in to [Graph Explorer](https://aka.ms/ge) and consent to the **Policy.Read.All** and **Policy.ReadWrite.AuthenticationMethod** permissions.

1. Retrieve the Authentication methods policy: 

   ```json
   GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/authenticationMethodsPolicy/authenticationMethodConfigurations/FIDO2
   ```

1. To disable attestation enforcement and enforce key restrictions to only allow the AAGUID for RSA DS100 for example, perform a PATCH operation using the following request body:

   ```json
   PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/authenticationMethodsPolicy/authenticationMethodConfigurations/FIDO2
   
   Request Body:
   {
       "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.fido2AuthenticationMethodConfiguration",
       "isAttestationEnforced": false,
       "keyRestrictions": {
           "isEnforced": true,
           "enforcementType": "allow",
           "aaGuids": [
               "7e3f3d30-3557-4442-bdae-139312178b39",
   
               <insert previous AAGUIDs here to keep them stored in policy>
           ]
       }
   }
   ```

1. Make sure that the passkey (FIDO2) policy has been updated properly.

   ```json
   GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/authenticationMethodsPolicy/authenticationMethodConfigurations/FIDO2
   ```


## Delete a passkey 

To remove a passkey associated with a user account, delete the key from the userâ€™s authentication method.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) and search for the user account from which the passkey is to be removed.
1. Select **Authentication methods** > right-click **Passkey (device-bound)** and click **Delete**.

## Enforce passkey sign-in 

You can use either a built-in phishing-resistant authentication strength or create a custom authentication strength to make users sign in with a passkey when they access a sensitive resource. The following steps show an example of how to create a Conditional Access policy that allows passkey sign-in for only a specific security key model or passkey provider.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as a Conditional Access Administrator.
1. Browse to **Protection** > **Authentication methods** > **Authentication strengths**.
1. Select **New authentication strength**.
1. Provide a descriptive **Name** for your new authentication strength.
1. Optionally provide a **Description**.
1. Select **Passkeys (FIDO2)** and then click **Advanced options**.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/concept-authentication-strengths/authentication-strength-custom.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the creation of a custom authentication strength.":::

1. Set Enforce key restrictions to **Yes**.
1. Set Restrict specific keys to **Allow**.
1. Add the AAGUID for passkey. For example: 7e3f3d30-3557-4442-bdae-139312178b39

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/how-to-enable-authenticator-passkey/optional-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing an allowed AAGUID.":::

1. Choose **Next** and review the policy configuration.


## Known issues

### B2B collaboration users 

Registration of FIDO2 credentials isn't supported for B2B collaboration users in the resource tenant.

### Security key provisioning

Administrator provisioning and de-provisioning of security keys isn't available.

### UPN changes

If a user's UPN changes, you can no longer modify passkeys to account for the change. The solution for a user with a passkey is to sign in to MySecurityInfo, delete the old passkey, and add a new one.
