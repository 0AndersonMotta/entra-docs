# Authentication methods usage & insights (preview)

Usage & insights enables you to understand how authentication methods for features like Azure Multi-Factor Authenticaion and self-service password reset are working in your organization. The insights and reports give you information both about authentication method registration and self-service password reset usage in your organization.

## Prerequisites

- You must have SSPR enabled in your tenant
- Recommended to enable the combined registration experience

## Permissions and licenses

The following roles can access SSPR Usage and Insights:

- Global Administrator
- Security Reader
- Security Administrator
- Reports Reader

No additional licensing is required to access usage and insights. Azure Multi-Factor Authenticaton and self-service password reset (SSPR) licensing information can be found on the [Azure Active Directory pricing site](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/).

## How it works

To access authentication method usage and insights:

1. Browse to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Browse to **Azure Active Directory** > **Password reset** > **Usage & insights**.
1. From the **Registration** or **Usage** overviews you can choose to open the pre-filtered reports to filter based on your needs.


To access usage & insights, go to https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/AuthenticationMethodsOverviewBlade. This will bring you to the overview:

The Users registered, Users enabled, and Users capable tiles show the following registration data for your users:

- Registered: A user is considered registered if they (or an admin) have registered enough authentication methods to meet the SSPR policy.
- Enabled: A user is considered enabled if they are in scope for the SSPR policy. If SSPR is enabled for a group, then the user is considered enabled if they are in that group. If SSPR is enabled for all users, then all users in the tenant (excluding guests) are considered enabled.
- Capable: A user is considered capable if they are both registered and enabled. This means that they can perform SSPR at any time if needed.

Clicking on any of these three tiles or the insights shown in them will bring you to a pre-filtered list of registration details, which is covered later in this document.

The Registrations chart shows the number of successful and failed authentication method registrations by authentication method. The Resets chart shows the number of successful and failed authentications during the password reset flow by authentication method. 
Clicking on either of the charts will bring you to a pre-filtered list of registration or reset events, which is covered later in this document.

Using the control in the upper, right-hand corner, you can change the date range for the audit data shown in the Registrations and Resets charts to 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days.

Registration details

Clicking on the Users registered, Users enabled, or Users capable tiles or insights will bring you to the registration details:

This report shows the following information for each user:

- Name
- User name
- Registration status (All, Registered, Not registered)
- Enabled status (All, Enabled, Not enabled)
- Capable status (All, Capable, Not capable)
- Methods (App notification, App code, Phone call, SMS, Email, Security questions)

Using the controls at the top of the list, you can search for a user and filter the list of users based on the columns shown. 

Reset details

Clicking on the Registrations or Resets charts will bring you to the reset details:

This report shows registration and reset events from the last 30 days including:
- Name
- User name
- Feature (All, Registration, Reset)
- Authentication method (App notification, App code, Phone call, Office call, SMS, Email, Security questions)
- Status (All, Success, Failure)

Using the controls at the top of the list, you can search for a user and filter the list of users based on the columns shown.

Upcoming features

- Faster data update
- API for accessing all report data

## Limitations

- The data shown in these reports will be delayed by up to **x** hours. A â€œLast refreshed" field exists in the Azure portal to identify how recent your data is.
- The registration failure data shown in the Registrations chart may be inaccurate. We will address this issue before public preview.
- The ability to download the details for registration and reset is not yet available. This will be available in public preview.

## Common questions

* Can a customer use this capability in production?
   * Yes, this feature should have no impact on end users and can be used in production.
