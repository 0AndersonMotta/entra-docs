# Troubleshoot Azure AD authentication strength

This topic covers errors you might see when you use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication strength and how to resolve them.  

## A user is prompted to use a different authentication method, but they donâ€™t see how to register that method

To evaluate if a method can be used, we consider which authentication methods the user has registered and enabled. For more information, see [How Conditional Access Authentication strengths policies are used in combination with Authentication methods policy](concept-authentication-strengths.md#how-conditional-access-authentication-strengths-policies-are-used-in-combination-with-authentication-methods-policy).

To verify if a method can be used:

1. Check which authentication strength is required. Click **Security** > **Authentication methods** > **Authentication strengths**. 
1. Check if the user is enabled for a required method:
   1. If you use the new Authentication methods policy, check if the user is enabled for any method required for the authentication strength. Click **Security** > **Authentication methods** > **Policies**.
   1. If you use the legacy Authentication methods policy, check if the tenant is enabled for any method required for the authentication strength. Click **Security** > **Multifactor Authentication** > **Additional cloud-based multifactor authentication settings**. 
1. Check which authentication methods are registered for the user in the Authentication methods policy. Click **Users and groups** > _username_ > **Authentication methods**. 

If the user is registered for an enabled method that meets the authentication strength, they might need to use another method that isn't available after primary authentication, such as Windows Hello for Business or certificate-based authentication. For more information, see [How each authentication method works](concept-authentication-methods.md#how-each-authentication-method-works). The user will need to restart the session and choose **Sign-in options** and select a method required by the authentication strength.

## How to check which authentication strength was enforced during sign-in
Use the **Sign-ins** log to find additional information about the sign-in: 

- Under the **Authentication details** tab, check the **Requirement** column will indicate the name of the authentication strengths policy.

- Under the **Conditional Access** tab, you can see which Conditional Access policy was applied. Click the name of the policy, and look under **Grant control** for the authentication strength that was enforced. 

## User sign in error when using a restricted FIDO2 security key
An admin can restrict access to specific security keys. When a user tries to sign in by using a key they can't use, this **You can't get there from here** message appears. The user has to restart the session, and sign-in with a different FIDO2 security key.
