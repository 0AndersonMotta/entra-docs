# How to enable Authenticator Lite for Microsoft Outlook

Authenticator Lite is an additional surface for AAD users to complete multifactor authentication using push notifications or time-based one-time passcodes (TOTP) on their Android or iOS device. With Authenticator Lite, users can satisfy a multifactor authentication requirement from the convenience of a familiar app. 

Authenticator Lite is currently enabled in the Outlook app. 

Users will receive a notification in their Outlook app to approve or deny, or use TOTP code of Authenticator in the Outlook app that can be entered during sign-in.
