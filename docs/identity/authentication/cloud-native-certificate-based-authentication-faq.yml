      - question: |
          How do I enable Cloud Native Certificate-based Authentication?
        answer: |
          1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as a Global Administrator.
          1. Click **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Authentication methods** > **Certificate-based Authentication** > **Basics**, click **On** to enable certificate-based authentication.

      - question: |
          Is cloud native certificate-based authentication a free feature?
        answer: |
          Certificate-based authentication is a free feature. 
          Every edition of Azure AD includes cloud native certificate-based authentication.
          For more information about features in each Azure AD edition, see [Azure AD pricing](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access-management/azure-ad-pricing).

      - question: |
          Does Cloud Native Certificate-based Authentication support *Alternate ID* as the username, instead of *userPrincipalName*?
        answer: |
          No, sign-in using a non-UPN value, such as an alternate email, is not supported now.
          
      - question: |
          Can I have more than one CertificateDistributionPoint (CDP) for a Certificate Authority (CA)?
        answer: |
          No, only one CDP is supported per CA.

      - question: |
          Can I have non-http URLs for CertificateDistributionPoint ?
        answer: |
          No, CDP supports only HTTP URLs.

      - question: |
          How do I turn certificate revocation checking on or off for a particular CA?
        answer: |
          We highly recommend not to disable CRL checking as you will not be able to revoke certificates. However, to disable CRL checking if there are issues with CRL for a particular CA you can update a trusted certificate authority and setting the crlDistributionPoint attribute to """.
          
          Use the [Set-AzureADTrustedCertificateAuthority](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azuread/set-azureadtrustedcertificateauthority) cmdlet:
          
          ```powershell
          $c=Get-AzureADTrustedCertificateAuthority
          $c[0]. crlDistributionPoint =””
          Set-AzureADTrustedCertificateAuthority -CertificateAuthorityInformation $c[0]
          ```

      - question: |
          Will the changes to authentication policy change take effect immediately?
        answer: |
          The policy is cached. After a policy update, it may take up to an hour for the changes to be effective.
          
      - question: |
          How do I instantly revoke a certificate?
        answer: |
          Please follow the steps to [manually revoke a certificate](active-directory-certificate-based-authentication-get-started.md#step-3-configure-revocation).
