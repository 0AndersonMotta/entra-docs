# Multi-tenant organization identity provisioning for Microsoft 365 (Preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Multi-tenant organization is currently in PREVIEW.

The multi-tenant organization capability is designed for organizations that own multiple Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants and want to streamline intra-organization cross-tenant collaboration in Microsoft 365. It's built on the premise of reciprocal provisioning of B2B member users across multi-tenant organization tenants.

## Microsoft 365 people search

[Teams external access](/microsoftteams/communicate-with-users-from-other-organizations) and [Teams shared channels](/microsoftteams/shared-channels#getting-started-with-shared-channels) excluded, [Microsoft 365 people search](/microsoft-365/enterprise/multi-tenant-people-search) is typically scoped to within local tenant boundaries. In multi-tenant organizations with increased need for cross-tenant coworker collaboration, it's recommended to reciprocally provision users from their home tenants into the resource tenants of collaborating coworkers.

## New Microsoft Teams

The [new Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/new-teams-desktop-admin) experience improves upon Microsoft 365 people search and Teams external access for a unified seamless collaboration experience. For this improved experience to light up, the multi-tenant organization representation in Azure AD is required and collaborating users shall be provisioned as B2B members.

## Collaborating user set

Collaboration in Microsoft 365 is built on the premise of reciprocal provisioning of B2B identities across multi-tenant organization tenants.

For example, say Annie in tenant A, Bob and Barbara in tenant B, and Charlie in tenant C want to collaborate. Conceptually, these four users represent a collaborating user set of four internal identities across three tenants.

For people search to succeed, while scoped to local tenant boundaries, the entire collaborating user set must be represented within the scope of each multi-tenant organization tenant A, B, and C, in the form of either internal or B2B identities.

Depending on your organizationâ€™s needs, the collaborating user set may contain a subset of collaborating employees, or eventually all employees.

## Sharing your users

One of the simpler ways to achieve a collaborating user set in each multi-tenant organization tenant is for each tenant administrator to define their user contribution and synchronization them outbound. Tenant administrators on the receiving end should accept the shared users inbound.

- Administrator A contributes or shares Annie
- Administrator B contributes or shares Bob and Barbara
- Administrator C contributes or shares Charles

:::image type="content" source="./media/multi-tenant-organization-microsoft-365/multi-tenant-user-sync.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows users synchronized across multiple tenants." lightbox="./media/multi-tenant-organization-microsoft-365/multi-tenant-user-sync.png":::

Microsoft 365 admin center facilitates orchestration of such a collaborating user set across multi-tenant organization tenants, see [Synchronize users in multi-tenant organizations in Microsoft 365 (Preview)](/microsoft-365/enterprise/sync-users-multi-tenant-orgs?branch=mikeplum-mto).

Alternatively, pair-wise configuration of inbound and outbound cross-tenant synchronization can be used to orchestrate such collating user set across multi-tenant organization tenants, see [What is a cross-tenant synchronization](cross-tenant-synchronization-overview.md).

## Inviting users

Instead of sharing users from a source to a target tenant, users may also be invited into the resource tenant, resulting in creation of the corresponding B2B collaboration users, see invitation manager in Microsoft Graph and Add B2B collaboration users in the Azure portal.

This mechanism of creating a collaborating user set includes invitation and synchronization of users via custom-scripted or alternative synchronization engines.

## B2B member users

To ensure a seamless collaboration experience across the multi-tenant organization in new Microsoft Teams, the B2B identities shall be provisioned as B2B users of <userType> **Member**, see Properties of a B2B guest user.

From a security perspective, admins may wish to review the default permissions granted to B2B member users, see Default user permissions.

For B2B identities in scope of synchronization via

- Synchronize users in multi-tenant organizations in Microsoft 365, or
- Cross-tenant synchronization in Azure AD

the <userType> property

- defaults to **Member**, but
- remains **Guest**, if the B2B identity already existed as **Guest**.

To change the <userType> from **Guest** to **Member** (or vice versa), a source tenant admin may amend the attribute mappings, or a target tenant admin may change the userType if the property is not recurringly synchronized.

For B2B identities not in scope of synchronization, the resource tenant admin may simply change the userType. Note that B2B identities shall have been redeemed to be recognized by new Microsoft Teams for seamless collaboration.

## Unsharing your users

Currently, there are no additional user deprovisioning capabilities provided other than capabilities intrinsic to Azure AD cross-tenant synchronization, see Deprovisioning.

By default, when synchronization scope is reduced while a synchronization job is running, users falling out of scope will be soft deleted, unless Target Object Actions for Delete is disabled, see Define who is in scope for provisioning.
