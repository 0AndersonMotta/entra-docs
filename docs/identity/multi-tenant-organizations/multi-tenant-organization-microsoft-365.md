# Multi-tenant organization identity provisioning for Microsoft 365 (Preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Multi-tenant organization is currently in PREVIEW.

The multi-tenant organization capability is designed for organizations that own multiple Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants and want to streamline intra-organization cross-tenant collaboration in Microsoft 365. It's built on the premise of reciprocal provisioning of B2B member users across multi-tenant organization tenants.

## Microsoft 365 people search

[Teams external access](/microsoftteams/communicate-with-users-from-other-organizations) and [Teams shared channels](/microsoftteams/shared-channels#getting-started-with-shared-channels) excluded, [Microsoft 365 people search](/microsoft-365/enterprise/multi-tenant-people-search) is typically scoped to within local tenant boundaries. In multi-tenant organizations with increased need for cross-tenant coworker collaboration, it's recommended to reciprocally provision users from their home tenants into the resource tenants of collaborating coworkers.

## New Microsoft Teams

The [new Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/new-teams-desktop-admin) experience improves upon Microsoft 365 people search and Teams external access for a unified seamless collaboration experience. For this improved experience to light up, the multi-tenant organization representation in Azure AD is required and collaborating users shall be provisioned as B2B members.

## Collaborating user set

Collaboration in Microsoft 365 is built on the premise of reciprocal provisioning of B2B identities across multi-tenant organization tenants.

For example, say Annie in tenant A, Bob and Barbara in tenant B, and Charlie in tenant C want to collaborate. Conceptually, these four users represent a collaborating user set of four internal identities across three tenants.

For people search to succeed, while scoped to local tenant boundaries, the entire collaborating user set must be represented within the scope of each multi-tenant organization tenant A, B, and C, in the form of either internal or B2B identities.

Depending on your organizationâ€™s needs, the collaborating user set may contain a subset of collaborating employees, or eventually all employees.

## Sharing your users

One of the simpler ways to achieve a collaborating user set in each multi-tenant organization tenant is for each tenant administrator to define their user contribution and synchronization them outbound. Tenant administrators on the receiving end should accept the shared users inbound.

- Administrator A contributes or shares Annie
- Administrator B contributes or shares Bob and Barbara
- Administrator C contributes or shares Charles

Microsoft 365 admin center facilitates orchestration of such a collaborating user set across multi-tenant organization tenants, see [Synchronize users in multi-tenant organizations in Microsoft 365 (Preview)](/microsoft-365/enterprise/sync-users-multi-tenant-orgs?branch=mikeplum-mto).

Alternatively, pair-wise configuration of inbound and outbound cross-tenant synchronization can be used to orchestrate such collating user set across multi-tenant organization tenants, see [What is a cross-tenant synchronization](cross-tenant-synchronization-overview.md).
