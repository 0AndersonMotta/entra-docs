# Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management - View usage analytics about users

The CloudKnox **Usage Analytics** feature contains details about identities, resources, and tasks that you can use make informed decisions about granting privileges, and reducing risk on unused privileges.

- **Users**: Tracks assigned privileges and usage of various identities.
- **Groups**: Tracks assigned privileges and usage of the group and the group members.
- **Active Resources**: Tracks resources that have been used in the last 90 days.
- **Active Tasks**: Tracks tasks that have been performed in the last 90 days.
- **Access Keys**: Tracks the privilege usage of access keys for a given user.
- **Serverless Functions**: Tracks assigned privileges and usage of the serverless functions.

The Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management **Usage Analytics** dashboard allows system administrators to collect, analyze, report on, and visualize data about all identity types.

This topic describes how to view usage analytics about users

## View data on the Users tab and table

On the **Usage Analytics** dashboard:

- The **Users** tab provides a high-level overview of user details. The following components make up the **Users** tab:
    - **Users**: This section  displays the total number of users, inactive and active users based on the authorization system selected. For more information, see View usage analytics about users.
        <!---Add link.--->

    - **Tasks**: This section  displays the number of tasks granted to a user, and the total number of unexecuted and executed tasks based on the authorization system selected.  For more information, see Use the Task Explorer.
        <!---Add link.--->

    - **Resources**: This section  displays how many resources have been accessed by users based on the authorization system selected. For more information, see Use the Resource Explorer.
        <!---Add link.--->

- The **Users** table  displays the privileges assigned,  privileges used, and resources accessed by users
    - **Username**: Provides the name of the user.

         - To view more information about a user, select their username. 

           Users are denoted with an icon for Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) users, an icon for Enterprise Directory (ED) user, an icon for local users, and an icon for cross-account users (users from another account). AWS roles, AWS EC2 instances, Azure applications, and Google service accounts are shown with their respective icons. 
           For more information, see View usage analytics about users.
        <!---Add link.--->

         - To view more information about the user, select the username. 

           Users are denoted with an icon for Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) users, an icon for Enterprise Directory (ED) user, an icon for local users, and an icon for cross-account users (users from another account). AWS roles, AWS EC2 instances, Azure applications, and Google service accounts are shown with their respective icons. 
           For more information, see View usage analytics about users.
        <!---Add link.--->

    - **Domain/Account**: This column displays a domain name for SAML or ED users and displays an account name for local users, AWS roles, AWS  EC2 instances, Azure applications, and Google service accounts.
    - **Privilege Creep Index** (PCI): Captures the incurred risk of users with access to high-risk privileges. Information is displayed in the following columns:
        - **Index**: Calculates a risk score for the user based on the high-risk privileges they have access to and if that privilege has been accessed, and the number of resources they can access.
        - **Since**: Indicates if the user's PCI is high, medium, or low based on the past 30 days. A user with a high PCI exceeding 30 days is denoted with an exclamation point (**!**), and provides the number of days the user has been marked at a high level, for example, **! High - 130 days**.

             As a system administrator, you can hover over the information in this column for specific details on how long the user has had a high, medium, or low privilege creep index (PCI). For example, if you hover over **! High - 130 days**, the following message displays: **The User's privilege creep index has been High since 14 February 2020, 1:37 PM in the authorization system**.

    - **Tasks**: Displays how many tasks are assigned to a particular user, and is broken into the following columns:
        - **Granted**: Captures the number of tasks that have been granted to the user directly, granted to the user if part of a group, or granted based on the AWS role type the user can assume.
        - **Executed**: Displays how many of the tasks the user has executed in the last 90 days.
    - **Resources**: Displays how many resources a particular user can access, and is broken into the following columns:
        - **All**: Captures the number of resources the user can access.
        - **Accessed**: Displays how many of the resources the user has accessed.
    - **User Groups**: Identifies how many groups a user belongs to.
    - **Last Activity On**: Displays the date and time the user last performed any type of task in the authorization system.

        A dash (**-**) displays if the user hasn't logged in or hasn't performed tasks in the last 90 days, .

    - **Tags** : Displays the number of tags applied to a user.

    -  To expand details about the user, select the **Tags** icon. 

       For more information, see Use the User Explorer. 
        <!---Add link.--->

## Apply filters for users

There are many filter options on the **Users** screen, including filters by **Authorization systems**, **User** types, and **Task** types. You can apply filters in one, two, or all three categories, depending on the information you want. 

- **Filtering by Authorization systems**
    1. To expand the **Authorization systems** menu, select the icon on the left side of the page. Then select all applicable systems.
