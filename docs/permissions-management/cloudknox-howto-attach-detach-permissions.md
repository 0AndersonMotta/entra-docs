# Attach and detach permissions for identities

This article describes how you can attach and detach permissions for users, roles, and resources manually or allow Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox) to do it for you using the Just Enough Permissions (JEP) Controller. You can create and approve requests for the Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) authorization systems.

> [!NOTE]
> To view the **JEP Controller** tab, your role must be **Viewer**, **Controller**, or **Administrator**. To make changes on this tab, you must be a **Controller** or **Administrator**. If you donâ€™t have access, contact your system administrator.
