# Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management product integrations

The Integrations function in the Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management application allows you to view sub-systems in one place, and to ensure all applications are functioning as one. This allows for improved quality and performance as a whole.

The following systems are integrated into the CloudKnox application:

- **ServiceNow** - Manages digital workflows for enterprise operations, and the CloudKnox integration allows you to request and approve permissions through the ServiceNow ticketing workflow.
- **Splunk** - Searches, monitors, and analyzes machine-generated data, and the CloudKnox integration enables exporting usage analytics data, alerts, and logs.
- **HashiCorp Terraform** - CloudKnox enables the generation of least-privilege policies through the Hashi Terraform provider.
- **CloudKnox API** - The CloudKnox application programming interface (API) provides access to CloudKnox features.
- **Saviynt** - Enables you to view Identity entitlements and usage inside the Saviynt console.
- **Securonix** - Enables exporting usage analytics data, alerts, and logs.
