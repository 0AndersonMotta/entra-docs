title: CloudKnox Permissions Management
summary: CloudKnox Permissions Management is a cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) solution that provides complete visibility into permissions for all identities (user and workload identities) across all major public cloud platforms (Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)) from a unified interface. It helps organizations understand what permissions identities have and what resources they're accessing. CloudKnox Permissions Management automatically detects which permissions are unused and risky and allows Security and Identity teams to right-size permissions in just a few clicks. Thanks to high-precision ML-based anomaly detection capabilities, CloudKnox Permissions Management streamlines threat detection and response and allows organizations to maintain a strong security posture.
