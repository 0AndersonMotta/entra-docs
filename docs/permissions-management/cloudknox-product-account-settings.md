# Set personal information and preferences

The Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox) **Account Settings** page allows you to set personal information, passwords, and account preferences.

- Click the caret icon on the right of the top menu bar, and then, from the dropdown menu, select **Account Settings**.

## How to edit personal information

1. Under **Personal Information**, click **Edit**.

2. In the **First Name** and **Last Name** boxes, enter the user's name. 

     The **Email** field cannot be modified because the CloudKnox account is linked to the email address used to register on the application.

## How to edit company information

1. Under **Company Information**, click **Edit**.

2. In the **Company** box, enter the name of the company. 

     The company name appears in the top-left part of the application.

3. In the **Title** box, enter the user's title.

## How to edit account preferences

1. Under **Account Preferences**, click **Edit**.

2. In the box next to **User Session Timeout (min)**, enter the number of minutes before you want a user session to time out.

## How to view organization information

The **Organizations Information** page displays the following information:

- **Name** - Lists the organization name.
- **Title** - Lists the user's title, if applicable.
- **Current** - A check mark displays here if the user is current.
- **Primary** - A check mark displays here if the user belongs to the primary organization.

If you are part of multiple organizations:

- You can switch to a particular organization. You will be asked to log in into that organization when you make the change.
- You can assign another organization as the primary organization. Next time you log in, you will log in to your primary organization.

## How to change the account password

1. Under **Change Password**, enter the following details:

      - **Current Password**
      - **New Password**
