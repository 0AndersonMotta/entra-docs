The **Account settings** dashboard in CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox) allows you to set personal information, passwords, and account preferences.

## Set personal information

1. In the CloudKnox home page, select the down arrow to the right of the **User** (your initials) menu, and then select **Account settings**.
1. On the **Account settings** dashboard, under **Personal information**, select **Edit**.

1. In the **First name** and **Last name** boxes, enter the user's name. 

     The **Email** field can't be modified because the account is linked to the email address that was used to register on CloudKnox.

## Set current organization information

1. On the **Account settings** dashboard, under **Current organization information**, select **Edit**.

     The organization name appears in the CloudKnox title bar.
