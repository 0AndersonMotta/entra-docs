The CloudKnox **Account Settings** page allows you to set personal information, passwords, and account preferences.

- Click the caret icon on the far right-hand side of the top menu bar, and then select **Account Settings** from the dropdown menu.

## How to edit personal information

1. Under **Personal Information**, click **Edit**.

2. Enter the user's name in the **First Name** and **Last Name** boxes.

     The **Email** field cannot be modified because the CloudKnox account is linked to the email address used to register on the application.

## How to edit company information

## How to view organization information

The **Organizations Information** page displays the following information:

- **Title** - Lists the user's title, if applicable.
- **Current** - A check mark displays here if the user is current.
