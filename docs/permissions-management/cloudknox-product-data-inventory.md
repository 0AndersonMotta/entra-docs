# Display inventory about created resources and licensing information for your authorization systems

You can use the **Inventory** dashboard in Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox) to display an inventory of created resources and licensing information for your authorization systems and its associated accounts.

## View inventory and licensing information

1. To access information about your data sources, at the top of the CloudKnox page, select **Settings** (the gear icon).
1. To view the resources created for the authorization systems, select the **Inventory** tab.
