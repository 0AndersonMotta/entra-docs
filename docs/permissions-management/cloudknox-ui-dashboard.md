# The CloudKnox dashboard

The Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management dashboard provides an overview of the authorization system and account activity being monitored. 

- **Authorization system types** - A drop-down list of authorization system types you can access. May include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure (Azure), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and so on.
 
- **Authorization systems** - Displays a **List** of accounts and **Folders** in the selected authorization system you can access.

- **Privilege Creep Index (PCI)** - A graph displaying the **# of Identities contributing to PCI** and the related PCI.

    The PCI graph displays a bubble in the upper right corner. The bubble displays the number of identities that are considered high risk. *High risk* refers to the number of users who have permissions that exceed their normal or required usage.
    - To display a list of the number of identities contributing to the **Low PCI**, **Medium PCI**, and **High PCI**, select the list icon in the upper right of the graph.
    - To display the PCI graph again, select the graph icon in the upper right of the list box. 

- **Highest PCI change** - A list of your accounts, the PCI, and the change in the PCI over the past 7 days.
    - To download the list, select the down arrow in the upper right of the list box.

        The following message displays: **We'll email you a link to download the file.** 
        - Check your email for the message from the CloudKnox Customer Success Team. The email contains a link to the **PCI History** report in Microsoft Excel format.
        <!---Ad Link reports@cloudknox.io---> 
        - The email also includes a link to the **Reports** dashboard, where you can configure how and when you want to receive reports automatically.
    - To view all the PCI changes, select **View All**.

- **Identity** - A summary of the **Findings** that includes the number of identities that are:
    - **Inactive Roles** - A list of roles that haven"t been accessed in over 90 days.
    - **Roles That Can Access Secret Information** - A list of roles that can access secret information.
    - **Over Provisioned Active Roles** - A list of roles that have more permissions than they currently access.
    - **Resources That Can Access Secret Information** - A list of resources that can access secret information.
    - **Roles With Privilege Escalation** - A list of roles that can increase privileges.

    To view the list to all findings, select **All Findings**.

- **Resources** - A summary of the **Findings** that includes the number of resources that are:
    - **Open Security Groups**
    - **Instances With Access To S3 buckets**
    - **Unencrypted S3 buckets**
    - **SSE-S3 Encrypted buckets**
    - **S3 Bucket Accessible Externally** 


## The CloudKnox dashboard components

The data provided by the CloudKnox dashboard shows metrics related to avoidable risk. These metrics allow the CloudKnox administrator to quickly and easily identify areas where they can reduce risks related to the principle of least privilege.

The CloudKnox dashboard contains two main components:

- Privilege Creep Index (PCI) chart - The PCI chart identifies: 
    - How many users who have been granted high-risk privileges but aren't using them. 
    - How many users are contributing to the PCI and where they're on the scale.

- Usage analytics summary â€“ Provides a snapshot of permission metrics within the last 90 days.


### The Privilege Creep Index

The PCI heat map shows the incurred risk of users with access to high-risk privileges, and is a function of:

- Users who were given access to high-risk privileges but aren't actively using them. High-risk privileges include the ability to modify or delete contents within the authorization system.

- The number of resources a user has access to, otherwise known as resource reach.

- The high-risk privileges coupled with the number of resources a user has access to produce the score seen on the chart. They're classified as high, medium, and low.

    - High (red) - The score is between 68 and 100. A user has access to many high-risk privileges they aren't using, and has high resource reach.
    - Medium (yellow) - The score is between 34 and 67. A user has access to some high-risk privileges that they use, or have medium resource reach.
    - Low (green) - The score is between 0 and 33. A user has access to fewer high-risk privileges. They use all of them, and have low resource reach.

- The number displayed on the graph shows how many users contribute to a particular score. 

    The distribution graph displays all the users who contribute to the PC. It displays how many users contribute to a particular score. For example, if the score from the PCI chart is 14, the graph shows how many users have a score of 14.

    - To view detailed data about a user, hover over the number.

- The PCI Trend graph shows you the historical trend of the PCI score over the last 90 days. 

    - To download the PCI History Report, select the **Download** icon.

### The Usage Analytics Summary

The **Usage Analytics Summary** section provides a snapshot of the following high-risk tasks or actions users have accessed, and displays the total number of users with the high-risk access, how many users are inactive or have unexecuted tasks, and how many users are active or have executed tasks:

- **Users with Access to High Risk Tasks** - Displays the total number of users with access to a high risk task (**Total**), how many users have access but haven't used the task (**Inactive**), and how many users are actively using the task (**Active**).

- **Users with Access to Delete Tasks** - A subset of high-risk tasks, which displays the number of users with access to delete tasks (**Total**), how many users have the delete privilege but haven't used the privilege (**Inactive**), and how many users are actively executing the delete capability (**Active**).

- **High Risk Tasks Accessible by Users** - Displays all available high-risk tasks in the authorization system (**Granted**), how many high-risk tasks aren't used (**Unexecuted**), and how many high-risk tasks are used (**Executed**).

- **Delete Tasks Accessible by Users** - Displays all available delete tasks in the authorization system (**Granted**), how many delete tasks aren't used (**Unexecuted**), and how many delete tasks are used (**Executed**).

- **Resources that Permit High Risk Tasks** - Displays the total number of resources a user has access to (**Total**), how many resources are available but not used (**Inactive**), and how many resources are used (**Active**).

- **Resources that Permit Delete Tasks** - Displays the total number of resources that permit delete tasks (**Total**), how many resources with delete tasks aren't used (**Inactive**), and how many resources with delete tasks are used (**Active**).

## View information about users, roles, resources, and the PCI Trend

To view detailed information about the following, select the number displayed on the heat map:

- **Users** - Displays the total number of users and how many fall into the high, medium, and low categories.
- **Roles** - Displays the total number of roles and how many fall into the high, medium, and low categories.
- **Resources** - Displays the total number of resources and how many fall into the high, medium, and low categories.
- **PCI Trend** - Displays a line graph of the PCI trend over the last several weeks.

- The **Identity** section below the heat map on the left side of the page shows all the relevant findings about identities, including roles that can access secret information, roles that are inactive, over provisioned active roles, and so on. 

    - To expand the full list of identities, select **All Findings**.

- The **Resource** section below the heat map on the right side of the page shows all the relevant findings about resources. It includes unencrypted S3 buckets, open security groups, and so on.
