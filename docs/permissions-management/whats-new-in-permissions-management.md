**Product capability:** Permissions Management

The ServiceNow Application for Microsoft Entra Permissions Management enables users to request time-bound, on-demand permissions for multicloud environments (Azure, AWS, GCP) through the ServiceNow portal. This integration aids organizations in enhancing their Zero Trust posture by enforcing the principle of least privilege for multi-cloud permissions. The ServiceNow app streamlines access permission requests within existing approval workflows.  

Get the ServiceNow app in the [ServiceNow app store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/24073ae31bfca9100e564082b24bcb56/1.0.1?referer=%2Fstore%2Fsearch%3Flistingtype%3Dallintegrations%25253Bancillary_app%25253Bcertified_apps%25253Bcontent%25253Bindustry_solution%25253Boem%25253Butility%25253Btemplate%25253Bgenerative_ai%25253Bsnow_solution%26q%3Dentra%2520permissions%2520management&sl=sh). 

### Public preview - Okta and AWS Identity Center identity provider integrations

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:**                        
**Product capability:** Permissions Management

Why does Permissions Management support third party identity providers (IdP) integration? By getting the insight into single sign-on data regarding permissions assignment to cloud environments, Permissions Management can provide more accurate analytics. By reading role assignments and user data from the IdP side, Permissions Management can effectively calculate permissions granted and as a result precise permissions creep. 

For [Okta Identity Provider integration](how-to-configure-okta-as-an-identity-provider.md), an admin needs to configure the API application to give the access to read Okta users, groups and apps via Okta APIs. Permissions Management reads Okta users, groups and apps via Okta APIs. 

For [AWS IAM Identity Center integration](how-to-configure-aws-iam.md), an admin can provide Permissions Management access to read user and role access configuration data from the management account by running the cloud formation template (CFT) in their AWS environment. After successful configuration, Permissions Management can read the data to calculate the analytics.
