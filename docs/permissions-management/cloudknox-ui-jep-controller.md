# The Just Enough Permissions (JEP) Controller dashboard

The Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox) Just Enough Permissions (JEP) Controller dashboard provides an overview of roles/policies, permissions, a list of existing requests for permissions, and requests for permissions you have made.

This topic provides an overview of the components of the **JEP Controller** dashboard.
