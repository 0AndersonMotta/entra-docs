# View existing roles/policies and requests for permission

The Just Enough Permissions (JEP) Controller dashboard in Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox) provides an overview of roles/policies, permissions, a list of existing requests for permissions, and requests for permissions you have made.

This article provides an overview of the components of the **JEP Controller** dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
> To view the **JEP Controller** tab, your role must be **Viewer**, **Controller**, or **Administrator**. To make changes on this tab, you must be a **Controller** or **Administrator**. If you donâ€™t have access, contact your system administrator.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Azure uses the term *role* for what other Cloud providers call *policy*. CloudKnox automatically makes this terminology change when you select the authorization system type. In the user documentation, we use *role/policy* to refer to both.

## Display the JEP Controller

1. Use the drop-down lists to select the **Authorization System Type** and **Authorization System**.
