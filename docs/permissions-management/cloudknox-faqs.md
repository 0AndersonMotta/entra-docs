<!---## Now that Microsoft has bought CloudKnox, will it drop multi-cloud support or reduce Ping, Okta, and other IDP integration?

Microsoft bought CloudKnox because it's a multi-cloud security service that meets customers where they are. Microsoft is doubling-down on multi-cloud security investments.

<!---## What will happen to the CloudKnox brand and product name?

In February 2022, we'll publicly announce an internal preview of the first Microsoft release of the CloudKnox service. At that time, we'll announce that the service is called **CloudKnox Permissions Management.**--->
