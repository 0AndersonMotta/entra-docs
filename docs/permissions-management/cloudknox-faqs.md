# Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management FAQs (For internal users and existing CloudKnox users)

This section answers frequently asked questions (FAQs) from internal users and existing Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management users only.

## Now that Microsoft has bought CloudKnox, will it drop multi-cloud support or reduce Ping, Okta, and other IDP integration?

Microsoft bought CloudKnox because it's a multi-cloud security service that meets customers where they are. Microsoft is doubling-down on multi-cloud security investments. We're continuing to expand our portfolio of multi-cloud products and services, including customers who use other identity provider (IDP) providers for authorization and other services. 

## What will happen to the CloudKnox brand and product name?

In February 2022, we'll publicly announce an internal preview of the first Microsoft release of the CloudKnox service. At that time, we'll announce that the service is called **CloudKnox Permissions Management.**

## What is the CloudKnox pricing model?

For pricing information, see the [Azure pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/) page in the Azure portal.  

## Does CloudKnox support Oracle?

We currently support Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and VMware (vSphere).

## Does CloudKnox have Jenkins or Bitbucket integration?  

Not yet, we're currently working on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) first; then weâ€™ll look at integration w Jenkins Bitbucket and others.

## Has anyone from Identity and Network Access (IDNA) joined the CloudKnox team to help them with integration?

Steve Ball now reports direct to CloudKnox CEO Balaji Parimi as the first Product Manager on the team. Steve is rapidly ramping up on the domain and product and focusing on efficient integration and shipping.

## How can I learn more about the CloudKnox team and technologies?

The [CloudKnox website](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcloudknox.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F12%2FCloudKnox-Customer-Success-Story-Horsley-Bridge-Partners.pdf&data=04%7C01%7Cstevebal%40microsoft.com%7Ca98b4790ed7146eca57208d988ee444f%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637691379216326312%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=D%2BIHpRNqA2d92rMn6RhOdo3LSXcSH7U4XxWUV9iqBXI%3D&reserved=0) has a rich set of resources available for customers who are interested in continuing to purchase the current product as we work toward releasing an official Microsoft SKU. 

We're also working on an internal SharePoint site to host details about product planning, customer tracking, rhythm of business, dashboards, licensing data, engineering, ActiveX Data Object (ADO) links, competitive landscapes, FAQs, and other resources for learning. 

*For internal users only*, we also have a CloudKnox SharePoint site where we store working documents, specs, slide decks, and history: [Identity & Network Access Division - CloudKnox](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/activedirectory/Active%20Directory%20Doc%20Library/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fteams%2Factivedirectory%2FActive%20Directory%20Doc%20Library%2FCloudKnox&viewid=03b0247d%2D981b%2D46e6%2D8d18%2D9dfbbbd66353). If you are unable to access this site, contact the CloudKnox Sales team. 

## I have customers who are interested in learning more about CloudKnox. Who should I contact to find out how to help my customers learn, try, buy, and use CloudKnox? 

Our sales and Global Black Belt (GBB) teams are continuing to sell CloudKnox to current and future Microsoft customers.

## Will Microsoft's CloudKnox just be for Azure? What integrations does CloudKnox have with Azure AD, Azure, and other Microsoft services?

We're continuing to deliver support for CloudKnox's multi-IaaS.  We're  onboarding the team, and focusing on a v1 product that uses Azure AD and helps customers manage access and reduce risk across Azure, AWS, Google, and other services.  Over time, we'll build out integrations with Sentinel, Azure Security Center, personal information manager(PIM), and other third-party ecosystem partner products.  

If you have customer scenarios or ideas for other integrations, contact Steve and Balaji.
