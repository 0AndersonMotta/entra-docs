# Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management FAQs (For internal users and existing CloudKnox users)

This section answers frequently asked questions from internal users and existing Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management users only.

## Now that Microsoft bought CloudKnox, will it drop multi-cloud support or reduce Ping, Okta and/or other IDP integration?

Microsoft bought CloudKnox because it is a multi-cloud security service that meets customers where they are. Microsoft is doubling-down on multi-cloud security investments and we will continue to expand our portfolio of multi-cloud products and services including customers who use other IdP providers for auth and other services. 

## What will happen to the CloudKnox brand and product name?

In the February time frame, we will publicly announce private preview of the first Microsoft release of the CloudKnox service. At that time, we will announce that the service is called **CloudKnox Permissions Management.**

## what is the CloudKnox pricing model?

(C-CIEM) is about $100 per resource per year, (resource = anything that uses CPU). We will announce the (M-CIEM) pricing plan after we release our Public Preview in early February 2022. 

## Does CloudKnox support Oracle?

Oracle and Alibaba are on our future roadmap, current support for AWS, GCP, Azure, VMWare (vSphere) 

## Does CloudKnox have Jenkins or Bitbucket integration?  

Not yet, we are currently working on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) first; then weâ€™ll look at integration w Jenkins Bitbucket and others.

## Has anyone from Identity and Network Access (IDNA) joined the CloudKnox team to help them with integration?

Yes, Steve Ball now reports direct to CloudKnox CEO Balaji Parimi as the first Product Manager on the team. He is rapidly ramping up on the domain and product, focused on efficient integration and shipping.

## How can I learn more about the CloudKnox team and technologies?

The [CloudKnox website](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcloudknox.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F12%2FCloudKnox-Customer-Success-Story-Horsley-Bridge-Partners.pdf&data=04%7C01%7Cstevebal%40microsoft.com%7Ca98b4790ed7146eca57208d988ee444f%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637691379216326312%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=D%2BIHpRNqA2d92rMn6RhOdo3LSXcSH7U4XxWUV9iqBXI%3D&reserved=0) has a rich set of resources for those interested in continuing to purchase the current product as we work toward releasing an official Microsoft SKU. We are also working on an internal SharePoint site where we will host details about product planning, customer tracking, rhythm of business, dashboards, licensing data, engineering and ADO links as well as competitive landscape, FAQs and resources for learning. 

*For internal users only*, we also have a CloudKnox SharePoint site where we store working documents, specs, decks and history: [Identity & Network Access Division - CloudKnox](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/activedirectory/Active%20Directory%20Doc%20Library/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fteams%2Factivedirectory%2FActive%20Directory%20Doc%20Library%2FCloudKnox&viewid=03b0247d%2D981b%2D46e6%2D8d18%2D9dfbbbd66353).

## I have customers interested in learning more about CloudKnox, who should I contact to initiate a discussion to help my customers learn, try, buy and use CloudKnox? 

Our sales and GBB (Global Black Belt) teams are working to continue selling CloudKnox now to current and future Microsoft customers. 

To jumpstart discussion and learn how you can help connect your customers to the CloudKnox sales team, contact CloudKnox Questions at [cloudknoxq@microsoft.com](cloudknoxq@microsoft.com). 

## Will Microsoft's CloudKnox just be for Azure? And what integrations does CloudKnox have with Azure AD, Azure or other Microsoft services?

We will continue to emphasize and deliver on CloudKnox's multi-IaaS support.  We are currently onboarding the team and focused on a v1 product that uses Azure AD and helps customers manage access and reduce risk across Azure, AWS, Google etc.  Over time we'll be building out integrations with Sentinel, Azure Security Center, PIM, other features and other third party ecosystem partner products.  If you have customer scenarios or ideas for other integrations, please let Steve and Balaji know so they can incorporate them in future roadmap considerations.
