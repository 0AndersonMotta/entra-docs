# Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management - The Usage Analytics explorers

The Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox) **Usage Analytics** dashboard allows system administrators to collect, analyze, report on, and visualize data about all identity types.

This topic describes how to use the Usage Analytics explorers.

The CloudKnox **Usage Analytics** feature contains details about identities, resources, and tasks that you can use make informed decisions about granting privileges, and reducing risk on unused privileges.

- **Users**: Tracks assigned privileges and usage of various identities.
- **Groups**: Tracks assigned privileges and usage of the group and the group members.
- **Active Resources**: Tracks resources that have been used in the last 90 days.
- **Active Tasks**: Tracks tasks that have been performed in the last 90 days.
- **Access Keys**: Tracks the privilege usage of access keys for a given user.
- **Serverless Functions**: Tracks assigned privileges and usage of the serverless functions.
