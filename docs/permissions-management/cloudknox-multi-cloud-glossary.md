# Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management multi-cloud glossary 

This topic provides a list of some of the commonly used multi-cloud terms in Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management.

| Term                  | Definition                                          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Cloud security        | Cloud security is a form of cybersecurity. It is the protection of data stored online via cloud computing platforms from theft, leakage, and deletion. </p>Methods of providing cloud security include firewalls, penetration testing, obfuscation, tokenization, virtual private networks (VPN), and avoiding public internet connections.     |
| Cloud storage         | Cloud storage is a service model in which data is maintained, managed, backed up remotely, and made available to users over a network.                |
| CIAM                 | Cloud Infrastructure Access Management     |
| CIEM                 | Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management, pronounced “Kim”      |
| CIS                  | Cloud infrastructure security      |
| CSPM                 | Cloud Security Posture Management (automated view of standards and compliance status)      |
| Delete task          | A high-risk task that allows users to permanently delete a resource.     |
| High-risk task       | A task in which a user can cause data leakage, service disruption, or service degradation.     |
| Hybrid cloud  	    | A hybrid cloud (sometimes called a cloud hybrid) is a computing environment that combines an on-premises data center (also called a private cloud) with a public cloud. It allows data and applications to be shared between them.                |
| IDS	                | Intrusion Detection Service
| IGAM	                | Identity Governance and Access Management      |
| JEP	                | Just Enough Permissions      |
| JEP Controller	    | The Just Enough Privilege (JEP) Controller tab. It contains all the permission management features.    |
| JIT	                | Just in time    |
| Multi-cloud	        | Multi-cloud is a phrase often said in the “tech world”, and it’s here to stay, at least for the foreseeable future. Embracing and learning the multi-cloud lingo is beneficial for practitioners, c-levels, and everyone in-between. This glossary is intended to help navigate through the cloud specific terms such as Microsoft Azure roles or Amazon Web Services identities; and cloud generic terms such as cloud permissions management.     |
| Multi-tenant	        | Multi-tenancy means that a single instance of the software and its supporting infrastructure serves multiple customers. Each customer shares the software application and also shares a single database.	                |
| PAM	                | Privileged Access Management     |
| PCI or Privilege Creep Index	| A number from 0 to 100 that represents the incurred risk of users with access to high-risk privileges. It is a function of 1) users who have access to high-risk privileges but aren't actively using them (for example, the capability to modify or delete contents within the authorization system), and 2) the number of resources a user has access to, also  known as their resource reach.</p> PCI measures the number of unused high-risk privileges that have been granted to all unique identities. It also takes into account the number of resources that an identity has access to but hasn't touched over the last 90 days.</p> PCI is an indicator of an organization's level of exposure to insider threat risks and their ability to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege (POLP), which is one of the most fundamental and essential concepts in security.</p> A PCI score of 100 represents the highest risk to the organization, indicating a high percentage of identities with excessive high-risk privileges, and broad but unnecessary access to cloud resources. Zero represents the lowest risk.    |
| Permission	        | Rights and privileges. Details given by users or network administrators that define access rights to files on a network.              |
| PIM	                | Privileged Identity management     |  
| POD	                | Permissions on Demand     |
| Public Cloud	        | Computing services offered by third-party providers over the public Internet, making them available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. They may be free or sold on-demand, allowing customers to pay only per usage for the CPU cycles, storage, or bandwidth they consume.                |
| Role	                | Grants permissions to users so they can do a set of tasks.                 |
| SIEM	                | Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), pronounced “See-im”.     |
| Tenant	            | A dedicated instance of the services and organization data stored within a specific default location.                  |
