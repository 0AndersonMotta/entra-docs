# The CloudKnox glossary 

This glossary provides a list of some of the commonly used multi-cloud terms at Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox). It's intended to help users navigate through cloud-specific terms such as Microsoft Azure roles, Amazon Web Services identities, and cloud-generic terms like cloud permissions management.

| Term                  | Definition                                          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ACL                  | Access control list. A list associated with files or resources that contain information about which users or groups have permission to access those resources or modify those files.    |

| Cloud security        | Cloud security is a form of cybersecurity that protects data stored online on cloud computing platforms from theft, leakage, and deletion. Methods of providing cloud security include firewalls, penetration testing, obfuscation, tokenization, virtual private networks (VPN), and avoiding public internet connections.     |
| CASB                  | Cloud Access Security Broker                   |

| CIAM                 | Cloud Infrastructure Access Management     |
| CIEM                 | Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management, pronounced “Kim”.      |
| CIS                  | Cloud infrastructure security      |
| CSPM                 | Cloud Security Posture Management (automated view of standards and compliance status)      |
| CWPP                  | Cloud Workload Protection Platform    |
| DRI                   | Data risk index. A comprehensive, integrated representation of data risk.    |
| Data risk management  | The controlled process an organization uses when acquiring, storing, transforming, and using its data, from creation to retirement, to eliminate data risk.    |
| Delete task          | A high-risk task that allows users to permanently delete a resource.     |
| High-risk task       | A task in which a user can cause data leakage, service disruption, or service degradation.     |
| Hybrid cloud  	    | A hybrid cloud (sometimes called a cloud hybrid) is a computing environment that combines an on-premises data center (also called a private cloud) with a public cloud. It allows data and applications to be shared between them.                |
| hybrid cloud storage    | A private or public cloud used to store an organization's data.    |
| ICM 	                | Incident Case Management 	                | 
| IDS	                | Intrusion Detection Service	                | 
| IGAM	                | Identity Governance and Access Management      |
| ITSM 	                | Information Technology Security Management     |
| JEP	                | Just Enough Permissions      |
| JEP Controller	    | The Just Enough Privilege (JEP) Controller tab. It contains all the permission management features.    |
| JIT	                | Just in Time    |
| MISE 	                | Microsoft Identity Service Essentials |
| Multi-cloud	        | Multi-cloud is a phrase often said in the “tech world”, and it’s here to stay, at least for the foreseeable future. Embracing and learning the multi-cloud lingo is beneficial for practitioners, c-levels, and everyone in-between.      |
| Multi-tenant	        | Multi-tenancy means that a single instance of the software and its supporting infrastructure serves multiple customers. Each customer shares the software application and also shares a single database.	                |
| OIDC	                | OpenID Connect. An authentication protocol which allows to verify user identity when a user is trying to access a protected HTTPs end point. OIDC is an evolutionary development of ideas implemented earlier in OAuth and OpenID.
| PAM	                | Privileged Access Management     |
| Permission	        | Rights and privileges. Details given by users or network administrators that define access rights to files on a network.              |

| POD	                | Permissions on Demand     |
| Privilege Creep Index (PCI)	| A number from 0 to 100 that represents the incurred risk of users with access to high-risk privileges. PCI is a function of users who have access to high-risk privileges but aren't actively using them. For example, the capability to modify or delete contents within the authorization system. It's also a function of the number of resources a user has access to, also  known as their resource reach. PCI measures the number of unused high-risk privileges that have been granted to all unique identities. It also takes into account the number of resources that an identity has access to but hasn't touched over the last 90 days. PCI is an indicator of an organization's level of exposure to insider threat risks and their ability to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege (POLP). POLP is one of the most fundamental and essential concepts in security. PCI scores of 100 represent the highest risk to the organization. They indicate a high percentage of identities with excessive high-risk privileges and broad access to cloud resources, some of which may be unnecessary to the user.  A zero score represents the lowest risk.    |
| Public Cloud	        | Computing services offered by third-party providers over the public Internet, making them available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. They may be free or sold on-demand, allowing customers to pay only per usage for the CPU cycles, storage, or bandwidth they consume.                |
| Role	                | Grants permissions to users so they can do a set of tasks.                 |
| SCIM	                | System for Cross–domain Identity Management |
| SCI–M 	            | Security Compliance Identity and Management    |
| SIEM	                | Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), pronounced “See-im”.     |
| SCP	                | SAP Cloud Platform. A platform as a service developed by SAP SE for creating new applications or extending existing applications in a secure cloud computing environment managed by SAP.|
| Tenant	            | A dedicated instance of the services and organization data stored within a specific default location.                  |
| UUID		            | Universally unique identifier. A 128-bit label used for information in computer systems. The term globally unique identifier (GUID) is also used.|
