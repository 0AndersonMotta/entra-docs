# View analytic information with the Usage analytics dashboard

The **Usage analytics** dashboard in Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox) displays detailed information about: 

- **Users**: Tracks assigned permissions and usage by users. For more information, see [View analytic information about users](cloudknox-usage-analytics-users.md).
    
- **Groups**: Tracks assigned permissions and usage of the group and the group members.  For more information, see [View analytic information about groups](cloudknox-usage-analytics-groups.md).

- **Active Resources**: Tracks resources that have been used in the last 90 days.  For more information, see [View analytic information about active resources](cloudknox-usage-analytics-active-resources.md).

- **Active Tasks**: Tracks tasks that have been performed in the last 90 days.  For more information, see [View analytic information about active tasks](cloudknox-usage-analytics-active-tasks.md).

- **Access Keys**: Tracks the permission usage of access keys for a given user.  For more information, see [View analytic information about access keys](cloudknox-usage-analytics-access-keys.md).

- **Serverless Functions**: Tracks assigned permissions and usage of the serverless functions.  For more information, see [View analytic information about serverless functions](cloudknox-usage-analytics-serverless-functions.md).

You can use this information to make decisions about granting permissions and reducing risk on unused permissions.
