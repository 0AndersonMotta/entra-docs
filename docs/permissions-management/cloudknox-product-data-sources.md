# Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management product data sources

2. On the **Data Collectors** tab, each authorization system is listed with the following details.
(*Data collector* may also be referred to as *Sentry*.)

     - **IP Address** - Displays the a specific Internet Protocol (IP) address or Domain Name System (DNS) name for the data collector.
     - **Data Types** - There are two data types that are collected:
         - **Entitlements -** The permissions of all identities and resources for all the configured authentication systems.
         - **Benchmarks -** The results of security best practices tests.
     - **Recently Uploaded On** - Displays whether the entitlement and benchmark data are being collected. 

     The status displays *ONLINE* if the data collection has no errors and *OFFLINE* if there are errors.
     - **Recently Transformed On** - Displays whether the entitlement and benchmark data are being processed.

      The status displays *ONLINE* if the data processing has no errors and *OFFLINE* if there are errors.
