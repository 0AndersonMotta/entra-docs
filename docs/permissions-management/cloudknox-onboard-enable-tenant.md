**To enable CloudKnox on your Azure AD tenant:**

1. Log in to your Azure AD tenant and select **Next**.
1. Open your browser and enter aka.ms/ciem-prod.
1. In the Azure AD portal, select **CloudKnox Permissions Management**.

    The **Welcome to CloudKnox Permissions Management** screen appears. 

    This screen provides information on how to enable CloudKnox on your tenant.

1. To provide access to the CloudKnox, create a service principal that points to CloudKnox.

    An Azure service principal is a security identity used by user-created apps, services, and automation tools to access specific Azure resources. 

    1. Copy the script on the **Welcome** screen:

        `az ad ap create --id b46c3ac5-9da6-418f-a849-0a7a10b3c6c`

    1. Paste this script into your command-line app (CLI) and run it.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't have an Azure CLI on your system, or an Azure subscription where you can run cloud shell, you won't be able to run this command. </p>For information on how to create a service principal through the Azure portal, see [Create an Azure service principal with the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli). </p>For information on how to get an az command and login with the no subscriptions flag, see [az login](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az-login).

    After the script runs successfully, the service application attributes for CloudKnox display. 

    You can view the **Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management** application in the Azure AD portal under **Enterprise Applications**.

1. To enable CloudKnox:

    1. Return to the **Welcome to CloudKnox** screen.
    1. Select **Enable CloudKnox Permissions Management**.
