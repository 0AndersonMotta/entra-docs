## Prerequisites

To enable CloudKnox on your Azure AD tenant, you must have:

- An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- A global administrator role.

## Enable CloudKnox on your Azure AD tenant

1. In your browser:
    1. Go to [Azure services](https://portal.azure.com) and use your credentials to sign in to [Azure Active Directory](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview). 

    1. In the Azure AD portal, select **Features highlights**, and then select **CloudKnox Permissions Management**.

    1. If you're asked to select an account to log in, log in as a global administrator to specified tenant.

        The **Welcome to CloudKnox Permissions Management** screen appears, displaying information on how to enable CloudKnox on your tenant.

1. To provide access to the CloudKnox application, create a service principal.

    An Azure service principal is a security identity used by user-created apps, services, and automation tools to access specific Azure resources.
    > [!NOTE] 
    > To complete this step, you must have Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell on your system or an Azure subscription where you can run Cloud Shell.

    To create a service principal that points to the CloudKnox application via Cloud Shell:

    1. Copy the script on the **Welcome** screen:

        `az ad ap create --id b46c3ac5-9da6-418f-a849-0a7a10b3c6c`

    1. Return to the Azure AD portal and select the **Cloud Shell** button on the navigation bar.
    1. Paste the script into Cloud Shell and press the Enter key. 
    
        For information on how to create a service principal through the Azure portal, see [Create an Azure service principal with the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli). 


        For information on the **az** command and how to log in with the no subscriptions flag, see [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az-login&preserve-view=true).
        
        For information on how to create a service principal via Azure PowerShell, see [Create an Azure service principal with Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/create-azure-service-principal-azureps?view=azps-7.1.0&preserve-view=true).

    1. After the script runs successfully, the service principal attributes for CloudKnox display. Confirm the **Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management** application displays in the Azure AD portal under **Enterprise applications**.

1. Return to the **Welcome to CloudKnox** screen and select **Enable CloudKnox Permissions Management**.

    This completes enablement of CloudKnox on your tenant and launches the CloudKnox **Data Collectors** settings page.

    Use the **Data Collectors** page to configure data collection settings for your authorization system. 

1. In the CloudKnox **Data Collectors** settings page, select the authorization system you want.
