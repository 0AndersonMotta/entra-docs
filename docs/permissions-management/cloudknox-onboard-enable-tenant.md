## Prerequisites

To enable CloudKnox on your Azure AD tenant, you must have:

- An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- A global administrator role.

## Enable CloudKnox on your Azure AD tenant

1. Open your browser and enter `aka.ms/ciem-prod`.
1. Log in as a global administrator to your Azure AD tenant.
1. In the Azure AD portal, on the **Features highlights** section, select the **CloudKnox Permissions Management** tile.

    If you're asked to select an account to log in, log in as a global administrator to specified tenant.

    The **Welcome to CloudKnox Permissions Management** screen appears. 

    This screen provides information on how to enable CloudKnox on your tenant.

1. To provide access to the CloudKnox application, create a service principal.

    An Azure service principal is a security identity used by user-created apps, services, and automation tools to access specific Azure resources.

    1. To create a service principal that points to the CloudKnox application:

    1. Copy the script on the **Welcome** screen:

        `az ad ap create --id b46c3ac5-9da6-418f-a849-0a7a10b3c6c`

    1. Return to the Azure AD portal and select the **Cloud Shell** button on the navigation bar.
    1. Paste the script into Cloud Shell and press the Enter key.

        If you don't have an Azure CLI on your system, or an Azure subscription where you can run Cloud Shell, you won't be able to run this command. 
    
        For information on how to create a service principal through the Azure portal, see [Create an Azure service principal with the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli). 


        For information on the **az** command and how to log in with the no subscriptions flag, see [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az-login).

        <!---(/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az-login&preserve-view=true)--->

    1. After the script runs successfully, the service application attributes for CloudKnox display. Confirm the **Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management** application displays in the Azure AD portal under **Enterprise applications**.

1. Return to the **Welcome to CloudKnox** screen and select **Enable CloudKnox Permissions Management**.

    The tenant completes enabling CloudKnox on your tenant and launches the CloudKnox **Data collectors** settings page.

    <!--- :::image type="content" source="media/cloudknox-onboard-enable-tenant/data-collectors-tab.png" alt-text="Data collectors settings page.":::--->

    Use the **Data collectors** page to configure data collection settings for your authorization system. 

1. In the CloudKnox **Data collectors** settings page, select the authorization system you want.

1. For information on how to  onboard an authorization system account, subscription, or platform on CloudKnox, select one of the following articles and follow the instructions:
